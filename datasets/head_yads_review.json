I remembered the curries and stir-fry dishes were ok but nothing really memorable.

Granted, it wasn't as bad as it could have been, but in my opinion, it was unacceptable.\n\nFor one thing, there was six or seven rats packed in one cage that was, what . . . \n1' x 9\", 1 x 8\"? Don't quote me on that - I'm not 100% sure, but regardless of the details, it was way too small for the number of rats that were in it. They weren't unhealthy; they didn't look very sick, but they definitely didn't look particularly healthy, either. \n\nThe guinea pigs were what really shocked me, though. If you know anything about guinea pigs, you'll know they need a lot of space - even just for one. This cage was the same size as the rat's cage (they all were). They barely had enough to room to walk, much less exercise or popcorn (which my guinea pigs do often). There were two guinea pigs packed in that thing, when it was way, way too small for one baby guinea pig. It also didn't look that clean - all the cages, in my opinion, were grungy. The whole place felt grungy and grimy. And they obviously weren't cleaning the cages everyday, which they should be doing. It would be more unfair to the animals to do anything but at least a small cleaning each day.\n\nThe prices are, indeed, pretty good, or at least better than the prices at the Petsmart I usually go to, so there's one point for Petco. \n\nAt last, the employees. Are they nice and cheerful? Yes. That is, until you politely point out that the guinea pig cage is way too small for them to be healthy and happy (I was trying my hardest to be polite, although I could have come across as rude), they (or the one I talked to) immediately turn defensive, telling you \"it's very temporary\" and \"we take them out every night\" (which I don't believe, but maybe a Petco employee can correct me on that?) and make a face at you, not once telling you they'll tell their manager (even if they won't) or you may be right, like a good employee would.\n\nWant your customers to come back? Here's a good tip: don't tell them they're wrong about something, and rudely correct them, obviously trying to rush them out. Humor them, even if they are wrong about something.\n\nOverall, I would recommend not shopping here. They don't take good care of their pets, and their employees are rude if you care about the animals when they plainly don't. Good prices? They don't make up for that.\n\nI apologize if I made this too long, and thank you if you read all of this, regardless of whether or not you agree with me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oqr6xovYM2BRrLojaO26Dg"}

Not...\n\nA group of eight of us show up tonight for \"dinner\" and drinks.  We get seated way the hell in the back.  I guess we didn't fit in with the rest of the crowd.  Two graphic designers, three filmmakers, a photographer and some friends.. ok?  The reason I point this out is that the waiter lets us know that this place isn't that classy of a place like LeBoca, so the people are.. well... less classy? The guy was digging himself a hole.\n\nSo we order drinks, which seem to take about 10minutes to get to our table.  In the mean time we're looking at our menu and the waiter leaves again for about 10min... he finally shows up and we order from this tiny little menu.   My girlfriend and I order some tacos and chips with guacamole, everyone else orders something a bit similar.  \n\nConversation is picking up while we wait for our food.  I see people coming and going and that's when we notice that our food is taking too damn long.  Finally after eating our small plate of chips and guacamole our food arrives. Probably about 45min later.  Here's the best part....\n\nSo the food shows up and after waiting for 45minutes, we get these tiny little tacos that look like they are from the menu of a 2 year old.  That's right.. each of the three tacos are literally two bites at most each.  Everyone eats their dinner in about 5minutes max..  pathetic.\n\nAfter our tiny little dinner, we ask for our bills..The waiter doesn't think to bring all our bills at once, no.. instead he brings one or two at a time. Guess he wants us to stick around? Who knows.. Finally the two filmmakers get their bill, pay and they leave.. couple other of our friends do the same.  My friend and I stay with our other friend who's still waiting on his bill.  He gets it and notices that his $15 meal was just charged $30 on his credit card.  He complains and the waiter vanishes for about 20minutes to fix his card.  When he comes back he gives some crap about fixing it and giving him a credit.. guess how much? Oh about 50 cents.. \n\nHe signed the slip and the remaining three of us left this crappy place.\n\nThe place actually does look pretty cool.

I am not sure if this was because the sign was not lit up or what. But, they are just 2 weeks old and maybe that hasn't been done or something. Just we aware that the sign might not be lit up when you go.\n\nVenue: It is actually kind of neat inside. There didn't seem to be any \"prime tables\" as all the tables were pretty much just 4-tops. Also, not a lot of seclusion if you are looking for that. About 40% of the venue is a bar, but isn't separated from the restaurant. Real sleek, suave bar. The kitchen is open. So, if the cook is spitting in your food then you will probably see them. I kind of liked having the open kitchen in a small venue.\n\nFood: I had the Green Chili Stew with macaroni and cheese. Go ahead, laugh at my mac & cheese. The green chili was a touch spicy but then again, I am a total spice sissy. Even with that said, it *was* good. I ate it all. \n\nThe mac and cheese was a different story. I jokingly ordered that right off the bat and our server raved about it. Said he loved it. My guest also ordered it. Without a doubt, the mac and cheese was awesome. Really, I think it was better than my green chili stew.\n\nCost: It cost us $48 for two people. This was with 2 mains, 2 sides, an iced-tea, and an alcoholic beverage. Not bad.\n\nBottom Line: I see this place succeeding... especially if people can find it with their light off outside.", "type": "review", "business_id": "I4bSn5gXsHuSPu7L-d_8nQ"}

It was significantly smaller than the sandwich places I normally go to. So I ignored the size and dove in. WOW! The bread was so good. Toasted without being dry, light. The meat was perfectly cooked, not chewy like the last sandwich I ordered at another place, the coleslaw was so good and flavorful, juicy without dripping all over the place. The chips were also really good! Now the sandwich was smaller than I am used to but it wound up being the perfect size. It was so good I can't wait to go back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "yA9gOueRPoQ4-Y8Xdu8k3Q"}

Brand new state of the art facility, so I'm assuming thats what your paying for at the ticket counter. A bit pricey if you ask me but the gift shop was actually reasonable so thats a wash in my book.....\n\nWe were just in time to catch a 3D documentary on the flight & life of a monarch butterfly. I've seen this before on the tele but it was pretty cool in 3D. Then from there we went into this staging room before the atrium were we got to see several different types of butterflies emerging from their cocoons. Pretty cool! This place is great because there is no rush, it's all at your own speed. After watching butterflies break out of their cocoons we were off to the atrium. a butterfly haven. NO TOUCHING, NO PICKING UP but if they land on you thats ok. Hard for a little girl to grasp so I had to keep reminding her. Trust me when I say the butterfly keepers are on it too! The only thing I don't like about this experience is Summer, it was nice and toasty in there and the humidity was off the charts. From there tho you can cool down in the snack shop before you continue on.....\n\nThe next area is about insects & fish. Really good displays of both & a shallow tank with sting rays in them for petting. Not as spectacle as sea world but worth saving yourself a 5 hour drive over. You make your way thru the gift shop and after that your at the entrance/exit, round 2-sure, there's no time limit, how great! \n\nMy recommendations is try enjoying this place in better weather, you'll get your monies worth for sure being able to stay longer.

Plate lunch is a term that us locals like to call our plates from a bbq or local eatery. A normal plate that you can get from ONO Hawaiian BBQ, L&L BBQ, or any other hawaiian places is that every entree comes with rice and mac salad. But Korean style plate lunches come with rice and 4 sides like mac salad, kimchee, cucumber kimchee, noodles, corn, salad, and seaweed plus a few other choices. Thas the key difference and so far this is the only place I have found this.\n\nI like this place the most compared to any other Hawaiian bbq spot out here is that they serve Meat jun and the sides.  Meat Jun is thinly sliced marinated beef that is egg battered, then pan fried, and served with a slightly spicy sauce. It is also a Korean entree that originated from Hawaii so don't really expect to find this at any other Korean restaurants.\n\nI recommend people to try this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "i_H_yKtISROjQ4eruSwyPw"}

Front door was wide open. Nice little place - got seated immediately and attended to by a fairly nice waitress. Imagine my surprise when I checked the menu and saw Vietnamese pho! I'm a big fan, and while I was guessing it wouldn't be up to par with more centrally-located places like Pho Thanh I decided to give it a shot. The wife had massaman curry which she asked to be made quite spicy (\"Thai Hot\" as they call it). My pho, as predicted, wasn't that great. The meat was cut into thick chunks and the broth was actually sweet! I called one of the servers over and asked about it - they said that the cook was used to Thai dishes and had put a little too much sugar in as that's the norm with other stuff like the satay sauce etc. Fair enough, like I said I was expecting it. Taste aside, it wasn't a huge bowl and it was $10 - very much overpriced. I honestly don't know why I got it at a Thai restaurant, I suppose it's just because I like it so much that when I saw it on the menu my eyes glazed over. Like getting a burger at a Dairy Queen or something? (shrug) Anyways, the wife thoroughly enjoyed her curry - quite spicy but not too spicy for her. Note that she was charged an extra $1 for brown rice - a little too nickel-and-dimey for my liking. My kid had his usual chicken satay sticks. The chicken was dry and leathery, so marks dropped for that. Decor was nice, menu was done very well (see my photo).\n\nAll in all a fairly average experience. We'll be back to check out other dishes (Thai ones! *8-) and to support this new local business, but these folk certainly have a lot of catching up to do before they draw level with Line Thai in Sun City and (so far) wouldn't be our first choice for lunch or dinner going forward if we were starving.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_K5cfCM7-zQZ1hXdbsc2fQ"}

We all arrived at 7:45 pm and or table was ready and waiting for us. The place was pretty packed for a Thursday night. \n\nAs soon as we sat down we were served chips and salsa then our waiter came to our table and took our drink orders.\n\nI have three standards when it comes to judging Mexican restaurants beans, rice and salsa. These three items will tell you whether or not you are in a quality Mexican restaurant. Thankfully, all three passed my test. \n\n(1) The salsa- The salsa here is to die for. WARNING: The chips & salsa here is addicting. I could make a meal out of their salsa and chips they were so awesome. The chips were crispy, tasty served hot and so fresh. Their salsa adds a zing to anything you put it on. The best part is they are FREE with an entr\u00e9e .\n(2) Beans- the beans was cooked to perfection. They were very tasteful.\n(3) Rice - was cooked perfectly. They tasted homemade. \n\nAll ten people got something different. By the silence during dinner they all enjoyed their meals. Afterwards everyone commented how they ate to much chis and salsa because they were so good and how delicious everything was.\n\nFor my entr\u00e9e I went against my usual instincts and ordered something new and different. I got the  Carne Macha (Shredded beef saut\u00e9ed with fresh tomatoes, onions, green bell peppers, and a special seasoning. Served with guacamole, rice, beans and choice of corn or flour tortillas). The Macha beef was overdone, dried out and looked burnt. I ate everything except the beef. Thank goodness I had chips & salsa to fill me up. I told our waiter how disappointed I was with the beef and pointed out I ate everything else. He offered to get me something different. I declined because everyone else was just finishing their meals. Later he took the meal off the bill.\n\nThe atmosphere is very festive and vibrant. The only thing keeping me from granting a 4 star rating is my meal was not to my liking. If my meal was expectable / enjoyable I would have given it a rating of 4. \n\nFOOD: The portions were ample so if you're a big eater you'll be pleased. They use fresh ingredients and their entrees look very inviting. Salsa and chips (complementary) is praiseworthy. Flavorfully spiced with a nice consistency, I wanted to take home a 5 gallon bucket of this stuff. The rice here is perfect!  AMBIANCE: The restaurant is really interesting to look at. You can tell that the owners take great pride in the restaurant.  They took the time to nicely decorate the restaurant although the d\u00e9cor is what you'd expect in a Mexican restaurant.  PRICE: Average for a quality Mexican restaurant. SERVICE: Our waiter and his helper were both very friendly attentive and efficient . CONCLUSION: characteristic d\u00e9cor. The atmosphere is great. Portions are big.  I enjoyed this place -- food, price, service, atmosphere -- everything you'd want.  Highly recommended  RETURN  FACTOR: 100%.\n\n    ***************** What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************\n\n5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! \n4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. \n3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. \n2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. \n1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT", "type": "review", "business_id": "I7IfnWW1nXljC4ZGqwPe-w"}

Two dishes, a rice and two naans was enough food for three plus enough leftover for a fourth diner.  So even though the prices are a bite high, it works out in the end.\n\nMango Lassi - creamy and refreshing, not too sweet\nChicken Masala - sauce was a little thick but well spiced\nMalai Kofta - sauce was a better consistency but was not a fan of the homemade cheese balls\nPeas Pulaou - ok\nPlain and Garlic Naan - both good but the garlic one kicks it up a notch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_RBUU1y4yJrK0SPAd8z0-w"}

I was excited, it included tasty food from all of the Fairmont's restaurants. But after the experience I had I won't be back. I was under the impression that this was a world class resort, however the service we received in the restaurant was below what I would expect at Applebee's. Don't get me wrong, the property is beautiful. The valet's were friendly and helpful, providing us directions to the LV Bistro where brunch was held. The hostess was friendly, quickly found or reservation and we were directed to our table, where we sat and waited to be greeted by our server for our drink order. \nWe waited, and waited. 15 minutes after we were sat, a woman approached us and asked if we were waiting another to join our party as she began filling a water glass. We told her were weren't, and we had been waiting for a while. She quickly turned and disappeared, leaving a half filled water glass (and water spilled on the table) behind. Another 5 minutes later a server with a tray of drinks appeared and told us he would be right with us. He dropped off the drinks and greeted a table that was just sat. A few more minutes passed and a female server greeted us and began taking out drink order and giving us the lay of the buffet when the male server returned to see if we needed anything else. Once we got our drinks, and found the buffet things went somewhat smoother. During this time we realized how cold we were. It was about 62 degrees when we arrived and the doors of the dinning room were wide open to the buffet outside. Those seated outside got space heaters, but inside we got sweeping breezes. Not what I would expect from this type of setting. \nI would be much more understanding if the restaurant was busy, but when we got there at noon, it wasn't. In fact, countless staff members wandered around the floor, diverting their gazes from our hungry and confused stares. I wanted to alert the hostess to the situation, but was asked not to by my companions. I have been a server, so I am understanding, but this was ridiculous. It's a buffet, we only needed to be greeted, and get drinks. There is no reason we should have had to wait 25 minutes to be greeted. I was seriously shocked that the manager and hostess making their way past us repeatedly failed to notice this either. I expected a wonderful experience, and while the food was good the overall experience fell short. I didn't feel that it was worth the $70 price to be neglected and freeze.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9mfec4ySQpW8doGs3FUP2Q"}

They have a beautiful relaxation room where you can lay down with cuddly blankets and read, take a nap, or eat some yummy snack mixes that are laid out.  It has a steam room and sauna, and awesome showers with showerheads everywhere.  There is also a little outdoor private area with jacuzzi and outdoor showers.\n\nI had a stone massage, which I hoped would never end.  When you walk into the room, they give you a choice of around 5 different mixes to listen to on their ipod depending on your mood.  I thought that was pretty cool too.  The staff was very attentive and friendly.  I wish I could have had more time to use the gym there too, that looked really nice also.  I would highly recommend spending a day at this spa.

We sit outside in the sun, which was hot but ok since we are inside all day anyway. Our waitress comes by and doesn't introduce herself or even say hi. She was very monotone and seemed like she was just mad at the day. I know it happens, we all go through those moments or days, but even when I was pissed or tired as a waitress, I was pleasant because I knew this was how I was going to make my money.\n\nSo she takes our order. I order the turkey sandwich special and my friend orders the chicken with taziki (sp?). Pretty simple stuff. Well we wait....and wait....and wait...and see people get their food who sat down and ordered after us....and we wait some more. She didn't bother to come out and talk to us or give us any info, updates or apologies but only when she checked on another table did she realize that we didn't have our food yet and had gone through two drinks each already. I know things happen, when you're busy things aren't ordered....anyone in the serving business has done it, but its how you handle it after the fact that matters. Never once did we get an apology or anything!\n\nWhen we finally got our food, my \"toasted\" sandwich was cold and the \"hot\" potatoes that came with it were cold as well. Unfortunately it was one of those situations where 1. I didn't want to be that customer despite the overwhelming feeling that I should be, and 2. I was too hungry and had waited FAR too long to wait any longer and we needed to get back to work.\n\nThe couple next to us as well as my friend received dirty glasses with lipstick stains and detergent on them- which again, happens but it just added fuel to the fire. \n\nMy food was only OK despite knowing that Pita Jungle can serve up way better than what they gave us this time around.

I found it instantly comforting instead of cramped quickly. \n\nYou have a hostess area right when you enter. I checked out the lounge to the right and it had about three or four major seating areas along with some tables-but the people sitting there looked way comfortable and they weren't about to leave anytime soon.\n\nWe went to the left and there were high tables and stools set up. Along the wall were large cushioned backs for loungers on the plush cushion. I opted for the stool and it was surprisingly fine-most stools for shorties make me feel weird since my feet are dangling. The rest of the space had more high tables and then a smaller bar area with stools. There was plenty of seating, and while it wasn't packed, everyone there looked like they were with friends or established dates and totally relaxed having drinks-I didn't feel any meat market here.\n\nI was disappointed by the wine by the glass selection (not the highest caliber-hence the minus start) so I stuck with the martini selection. Most 'tinis don't go under 7.50 but they also don't go over 10-pretty reasonable. The waiter was very down to earth and told me the truth about buying cigarettes-that the bar down the street would have them and be like 7.50-no thanks! So mad props to him for the low down.\n\nWe got the Summer Peach, the S'mores, Afternoon Delight, and Raspberry \"\" (blanking out on drink name-sorry!). They fill their drinks to the brim and they are pretty damn strong. The peach one was refreshing and not overtly sweet-much like a belletini. The raspberry was like a popsicle...an ADULT popsicle-a bit too sweet for me but had real raspberries on the bottom. The afternoon was a personal favourite of mine-citrusy but not too sweet, I'll def. get this drink next time. The s'mores was out of control-graham cracker crust? An actual marshmellow in it? Whoa.

Saturday is usually the most busy day for every dim sum places. The restaurant is pretty empty out. \n\nWe sat down and order 5 dishes. That's where the problem came. I don't like to be treated like moron. Why there is 6 dishes marked on the sheet? \n\nWe kindly asked manager to check it out. Long story short, they turn into deny mode. And finally removed the extra marked item we never ordered without offering any apology and sorry. Mistake does happen, but don't pretend that you don't know it. Admit it. The portion of the dishes are also shrinking. With the price and services, I can find better dim sum place. Yes. I am really picky on the food quality and service. \n\nFool me once is enough.

Now with that said my wife and I have been to a few of the joints showcased on that show.  As many of you that have started this journey like we have you find killer places and some okay places.  Matt's is a KILLER place.\n\nMy wife and I were recently in the Phoenix area for a part of our vacation and planned to stop in for breakfast at Matt's the first morning.  We got there ~8am on Saturday morning and only had to wait about 15 minutes.  Yes the place was small but being the two of us it was not a challenge.  There are about 9 tables total (assuming setup for 2) and 8 or so counter spots.\n\nThe food is awesome!!  It was so good we changed our plans and went back the next morning! \n\nHere is what we had:\n\nPork chop marinated with pesto and eggs with home fries, side of bacon and toast with their very tasty home made jelly.  The pork chop is to die for.  I am a big pork chop for breakfast fan and usually very disappointed.  Not at Matt's, it was tender and cooked perfectly.  My eggs were cooked exactly like I asked for and the bacon is like think slices of heaven!  I had to have bacon both mornings and I am not a breakfast bacon fan usually.  This bacon would make anything taste great!  My wife had the daily special which was chicken sausage, fresh spinach and fontina cheese scramble.  Once again cooked perfect, not greasy at all but with big flavor.  We both had home fries which were incredible.  Nice crust with some rosemary and caramelized onions.  Pretty close to perfect!\n\nThe next day my wife had the waffle, which she liked.  The fresh maple syrup was the real star of this dish.  She was kind enough to pass the bacon to me (I know twist my arm).  I had the breakfast special which was a sirloin steak, eggs and hash browns.  The steak was SUPER tender and cooked EXACTLY how I asked (you can tell I do not experience that often).  It was obviously a good cut of meat and had been seasoned very nicely.  The hash browns were very nice.  Crust on both sides and tender in the middle.  Exactly what you would hope for.  Lastly was their toast and home made jelly.  It was like butter!!!  Nothing like your store bought jelly.  I am not a jelly fan but ate all of it both mornings!!!\n\nAs for the service it was pretty good.  They were slammed on the first morning but were pleasant.  The family atmosphere really made the hustle and bustle not so bad.  The second time we went in they remembered us and took the time to talk for a few minutes and show their appreciation for us coming back so soon.  Very nice touch!\n\nOverall this now my favorite breakfast joint from Triple D.  Whenever I travel to Phoenix I will plan to stop in.  I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants breakfast cooked the way it should be!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ntN85eu27C04nwyPa8IHtw"}

Instead, I had their chicken caesar salad. Good lord I'd died and gone to heaven with a dish like that...not too much dressing, tons of leafy lettuce and chicken that was cooked just right!\n\nWe loved the idea of the pews. I liked it because it reminded me of being back in Scotland. :D\n\nService rocked it! Friendly and kick ass, prompt! They are making me fall in love with them.\n\nA month later, I take hubby there...I order the same thing...and am massively disappointed. The lettuce is wilted, chicken is the best part of the salad and sadly, there is so much dressing I was distraught.\n\nAgain, service rocked it...but hubby was most impressed with the happy hour prices of the beers and the size...and the selection. He wasn't happy with is pasty which was ok by my standards.\n\nToday I had a craving for a pasty. Hopped over there and had their chicken tikka. It was aight. Nothing to make me do cartwheels or dance on the tables. Ok, if I danced on the tables, I'd really be embarrassed because my ass would break it. I'm sure of it.\n\nAnyway, I'll give this place another whirl next month and see how it goes.

The office people intentionally mislead us about the security insurance policy - it is not the equivalent of a security deposit - so that when we left we owed them a ton of cash because they claimed that we ruined their crappy shag carpet.  No amount of contact with the local office staff or their corporate overlords ever rectified the situation, so we paid the fee to avoid having a blemish on our renting history.  I regularly curse at the building as I'm going by the convenient location.\n\nI would never recommend this complex to anyone, but my friend, who was my roommate at the time that we lived at Camden, decided to give them another try.  Cell phone reception is still horrible, he has to leave his phone on the window sill.  His $800-a-month one-bedroom turned into nearly $1000 per month due to all of their mandatory fees.  Fees include valet garbage even though he has to walk by a dumpster to get to his car, mandatory $45 basic cable and so on.

We were seated a one of the oversized wooden four tops overlooking the patio from one side and peering into the kitchen from the opposite. I was facing the kitchen and enjoyed watching the action and seeing all the enticing entrees and apps coming out. It was also cool to see Chef Eddie doing his thing back there and working just as hard as any of his employees. The decor of the place reminded me of a southern country club: dark, rich colors, nice but not pretentious, and comfortable.\n\nWe started with two orders of the Mo'rockin shrimp, one per couple because they were so highly touted. After my first bite I was so thankful we had done so. First,they tasted incredible!!! So many flavors in one bite- I could lick the plate and die happy! Second, there are only four shrimp per order and no one deserves only one bite of those delicious little morsels. I questioned the biscuit balls at first glance but after splitting one in half and sopping up the remaining sauce on the plate I understood how tasty and functional they were. \n\nMy side of the table split a Caesar  salad that had great dressing but was a tad hard to eat for me because it was not chopped. I made lots of noise chopping it myself, but still managed to make it work. My other half was not pleased with the chopped olives sprinkled on top, but I liked the extra favor acidity they added. \n\nFor dinner I had the whole portion of sea bass and it was literally perfect. I can't say I have ever had better. It was served with some gorgeous and just as tasty broccolini. Sharing is a common occurrence among the four diners who were present, so I got to taste a little bit of everyone's! My guy had \"what's in my steak\",  which looked like a giant edible softball on a plate, but tasted like a big sweet hug from grandma! Comfort food extraordinaire!  It reminded me of something Willy Wonka would make. Crazy looking but scrum-diddily-umptious! The tuna and halibut from \"east meets west \" were both excellent, and the golden beet slices that accompanied the scallops were delish. \n\nFinally, for dessert the birthday boy in our group chose the \"chocolate pot du creme\". Holy mother of all that is chocolate! This was amazing!! It looked and tasted like liquid fudge. It was incredibly rich and decadent and perfect to share. \n\nAll of this deliciousness, accompanied by two bottles of La Crema Chardonnay,  plus my lovely dining companions equalled a five star review and a lasting memory of a wonderful night.", "type": "review", "business_id": "He9Dar4bk2vyeiPC7TkUgA"}

We were seated, and started with the pork belly and burrata mozzarella.  Pork belly is very fatty - and I'm never prepared for it - so it always catches me off guard.  But it was nice with the lentils.  The fresh mozzarella was really good with the tomatoes.  For the entree, Angie got the salmon and I got the flatiron.  The salmon was on a nice orzo salad and really felt like a complete meal.  The skirt steak was more of a de-constructed steak salad.  The arugula with parmesan was good, and the steak was seasoned nicely, but the meal just left me wanting more if that makes sense.  Maybe a starch would help complete the dish, but as is I wouldn't consider it an entree.  The desserts were just ok, I had the gelato trio and the pistachio one was tasty but the rest were just forgettable.

Reyes de la Torta will do it. \n\nI had always heard about this place from the youth I worked with. They said it was amazing. Once I went, I was hooked. \n\nYou're going to get a completely different feel from this place. Yeah, it's in a strip mall; yeah, the hostess may stick you and your party at a table smaller than you're accustomed to; Yeah, there is soccer playing on the TVs instead of the news; .. but the food will make you not care about any of those things. Plus, they are always playing Salsa, not loud or rambunctious, trumpet-filled music. This adds to the experience as it makes me feel like I may be somewhere resembling my homeland of Colombia. \n\nWhen you're asked for your drink order, make sure you ask for one of their aguas frescas... translation: fresh juice. I always get the Agua Fresca de Limon. It reminds me of the limeade I drink when I am back home in Colombia - this drink makes the whole experience worth it.  The chips and salsa are good, although you might want to watch out with the salsa if you're not a spice fan. \n\nOk, the restaurant is named the king of the tortas ... and you ask what is a torta?? To Mexican people, a torta is sandwich of meat, vegetables and anything else they may throw on there made on a hamburger-style bun - and that is what they're famous for -  that is why Adam from Man vs Food went there. But, I have never had their tortas simply because at Reyes you will enter a homemade-tortilla heaven that is like nothing else. These tortillas are amazing, from their texture, to their slight greasiness, to their taste, they are the best tortillas I have ever had. \n\nSo, in order to continue to eat the best tortillas ever, I always get the chicken quesadilla. Yep, it's simple, but amazing. You can also choose to get it \"Estilo del Rey\" which means they top off your quesadilla with more cheese ( white cheese, not crappy, yellow, greasy cheese), sour cream and green onions. That in itself sends this quesadilla into the history books. \n\nDo yourself a favor and check out a truly unique restaurant tucked away in a strip mall just south of Hatcher on 7th Street.

I order a BURRITO, with MEAT.  I have eaten at over FOUR Chipotles, which basically makes me an expert of Chipotle, burritos, and all food in general.\n\nOne of the greatest things about Chipotle is consistency; you can walk into a Chipotle in anywhere in the world and you know that your food is going to be fresh and delicious.  What you don't necessarily know though, is the attitude.  Is this a Chipotle where everyone is happy and burritos are being tossed joyously from one person to another in celebration of food preparation?  Or is this Chipotle run by a dirty, filthy man who hates you simply for being alive, and will follow you out to your car and mug you?  Nobody knows.  Except me, because I've eaten at this one several times.\n\nThis is a magnificent Chipotle.  The people are good spirited, helpfully construct your burrito quickly, and pleasantly.  Sometimes I go into this Chipotle and I'm like, \"Eh, not having such a great day - maybe a burrito will make me happy\" and do you know what?  I go into this place, and everybody is happy and working and it's like, \"Yeah... yeah now I'm feeling a little better.  Maybe things aren't so bad.  Maybe she still loves me.\"\n\nSo to summarize, this is a great Chipotle.  It's bright, friendly, ample parking, and the same fresh and delicious ingredients you expect.", "type": "review", "business_id": "R2IWbpUgJQ3NRRjKQy6O_Q"}

We than moved  on to the spicy tuna roll, which is made just with Sriracha and doesn't have any mayonnaise to mask the flavor of the fish.  We had a few more orders of hamachi and then ordered the \"Snow White\" roll, (a daily special) which was the spicy tuna roll with white tuna on top and garnished with a dab of Sriracha on top. It was excellent!  We then asked the sushi chef for his recommendation and he made us an order of albacore tuna sushi with a miso mustard sauce on it.  What an incredible presentation!  We immediately ordered another order.  Overall, the cuts of sushi were very meaty and everything was incredibly fresh. \n\nThe atmosphere was slightly lacking, but the sushi chef (owner) told us that he was in the process of ramping up and had already ordered a large fish tank to go on one wall and was planning to re-do the paper lanterns with hanging lights.  He also told us that he's been in the U.S. for 18 years now and finally has his own restaurant after starting out as a dish washer (kudos to him!) and that he can't believe how his competitors will serve day old fish.  \n\nI think we've found our new North Scottsdale go-to sushi place!", "type": "review", "business_id": "nKrK1aK2uWtL57Q3ShH6Hg"}

I plan on trying Marcella's for lunch and/or dinner in the near future, so I'll update once I do.\n\nWhen I heard Marcella's was opening at Fashion Square, I was so excited. Marcella's originated in Columbus, Ohio, and there are two locations there. My Ohio friends rave all the time about Marcella's -now that it is here in Scottsdale, I finally could find out what all the buzz was about.\n\nMarcella's is located next to Modern Steak and is in the new Barney's wing. Parking is available in the lot across from Grand Lux, and if there are no open spots, in the evening you can park in the underground garage. I met a friend who moved here from Columbus for happy hour last Wednesday night. I arrived first and secured us two spots at the outside bar. Our bartender, Josh (I am pretty sure that was his name), was a sweetheart and chatted with us quite a bit and provided excellent service.\n\nMy friend had the red sangria which she really enjoyed while I stuck with Stella Artois. As a note, the beers on draft are Peroni or Stella. No cheapo American beers here on draft thankfully. For food, we had the zucchini, garlic cheese bread, and the pesto shrimp pizza. All the food was really good, especially the pizza. The food was great, but what is even better are the happy hour prices! The appetizers range from $2.25 to $4.95, while the pizzas will run you from $4.95 to $6.50. Beer and sangria are $3, wine by the glass is half off, and martinis and specialty cocktails are $5. Plus happy hour runs from 3-7 pm, so working people can actually make it and enjoy a few drinks. Marcella's definitely has the best happy hour deal in town now that it is open!\n\nI can't wait to go back to try more of the appetizers and to have a full meal.

Most of the menu ranges from mediocre/uninteresting to genuinely bad. It took me awhile to find something I liked here (came back because my friends loved it). There are some obvious staples that you can't go wrong with  like cheese quesadillas, ground beef tacos, etc. The cheese quesadillas especially are amazing as a simple item almost everyone would like, and although they can be expensive (not counting the $1.19 jr. quesadillas on friday!), it's only because they're huge!\n\nBut the best thing at FiliB's, to me, is the Arizona burrito drenched in hot sauce. Their hot sauce is amazing by the way. Most of their steak-based burritos are great. Carne Asada, AZ, California. Their fish tacos and shrimp burritos are great too, though a little pricey. So yeah, generally, Filiberto's has some great greasy fast food if you know what to order.\n\nThe reason this only gets 2 stars though, is that even the \"good\" food here is pretty bad. I don't know what it is about this location, if their employees don't know how to work a grill or if they use worse ingredients, but their food is consistently worse than other locations (specifically the one on Guadalupe and McClintock, which is always amazing and has free chips too!). But the cheese in the burritos consistently comes completely unmelted, the meat in them is always weirdly textured, and the employees clearly don't give a shit about helping you at all.\n\nAnd not that it really matters that much, but the interior of this place is kind of a shit-hole. I've seen worse in this chain, but I've seen much better as well.\n\nOverall: I go to this place because it's the closest filiberto's to me and sometimes I crave it.

You have not lived until you've tried this stuff! It's cooked in a buttery miso glaze that compliments the fish perfectly. I've had black cod and butterfish at other restaurants, but nothing has ever come close to the black cod at Yasu. This is a melt-in-your-mouth, little-slice-of-heaven kind of treat.

My son only wanted a cheese crisp and the kids combo (which isn't much of a combo only one side and no drink included) was 4.75 and when I asked the price for just a Kids cheese crisp the waiter said it was going to 5.95. He said that there is no option to have the kids crisp by itself, they give you the adult size app crisp instead and charge full price.

This place reminds me of a narrow cave that happens to have a long bar with about 18 stools, six larger booths that can fit five patrons comfortably, four table tops, and three double occupancy booths. The bar is pretty cool, its lined with red lights and has eight rather large flat screen TVs you can see from the stools and the larger booths that we were seated at. I opted for the Sweet and Spicy burger ($12), thanks to Yelp, and my mom went with a plain ole cheeseburger ($11). Knowing that the burgers do not come with anything, we decided to order the sweet potato fries ($5) and both got iced teas ($2.5 each). My burger was delicious and was everything the title said it would be...sweet and spicy thanks to the sweet glazed jalapenos. I also enjoyed the crunchy, deep fried ratatouille, yum. My mom wasn't impressed with her simple cheeseburger and said she would order mine if she were to come back and we both enjoyed sharing the sweet potato fries.\n\nBrent, our server, did a great job with suggestions and service. As lunch time got more busy and he got more tables he was always checking in with us and even put our iced teas in to-go cups. This place was, as the default Yelp display states, a-ok.  I'm glad I tried The Grind, but probably wouldn't suggest this place for lunch, but wouldn't hesitate to come back here if it is suggested by friends.\n\nBreakdown:\n\none star for being a narrow cave\none star for the Sweet and Spicy Burger   -and-\none star for Brent, our awesome waiter.", "type": "review", "business_id": "r-a-Cn9hxdEnYTtVTB5bMQ"}

Another 10 mins. and a waitress asked about drinks and we ordered a bottle of wine and menus.

They are consistently decent, rarely outstanding.  If I want outstanding, there are non-chain restaurants that can fill that need.\n\nBut today was different.  We went there for Sunday lunch, party of six, and although it overall went well, it was one of the very rare occasions where my meal was screwed up.  I had a steak off the menu, and since their web site sucks and I can't pull down a menu and find the actual name, I can't name it.  But it had a parm sauce with bread crumbs, came with balsamic drizzled asparagus, and garlic mashed potatoes.  The waitress asked if I wanted it medium or medium well, I ordered medium well.  A straight-forward order, nothing custom.\n\nEveryone's food came out, albeit slowly, and I started sawing through my meat.  And I mean saw.  It was tremendously over-done.  I sent it back.  And waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Not only had everyone else finished their meals while I waited, but one couple had to leave.  My remake arrived, delivered by the manager, and I stuck my fork in to it and found it was not over-done.  First bite was great, then my wife commented that it was bleeding.  I know the juice is not blood, but it was very rare, well below medium-well.  I cut another piece and noticed something odd, so I scraped the toppings off and found that the cook (I will not use the term chef since they could not properly cook a small steak) had cut in to the meat to see how done it was, then covered it up with topping.  If they saw it was under-done, why didn't they just continue to cook it?\n\nSo I asked again for the manager and explained the situation.  She was very apologetic and It was taken off the bill, a substitution was offered but everyone else was done and I didn't want to detail the other three.  So aside from salad and two breadsticks, my lunch was balsamic-drizzled asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nMy wife theorized a possible explanation.  Since I did not actually send the original plate back, they couldn't see how over-done my original was, and they deliberately under-cooked the replacement.  Perhaps if I'd actually sent the plate back they would have seen it wasn't correct.\n\nTo be fair, everyone else's meal was fine.  But I would suggest that if you order steak at this Olive Garden, make sure it is done properly.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OIBrslaVxFxaaGUsYFUujg"}

Which I find preposterous.  Would they have a list judging the best movie about grass growing?  \"In the end, Crabgrass beat out Ragweed just because of the potential allergens.\"\n\nNo, because sometimes you can make an entire category of things that suck, and chain restaurants, as a general rule, serve shitty steak. Not that I'm judging.\n\nSo if you go to Outback, don't expect anything amazing, despite the fact that zagat said they were tasty.  But outback is worth visiting anyway, because have you ever had their shrimp appetizer served on their brown bread garlic slab-thing?  The bread is better than the shrimp.  It's amazing.\n\nBut truly legendary status is only accorded thusly: imagine an appetizer with so many calories that three could share and still crack a thousand calories each?  Enter the cheese fries with bacon and a glob of ranch and you will know what spoonfuls of lard feel like to your arteries.  This particular location has a number of great bartenders and if you go there looking for a pleasant time and decent food, you'll be satisfied.  Chicken breast with BBQ sauce: palatable.  Broccoli with crab-butter sauce?  Tasty.  Rack of lamb? Surprisingly good.  Really there are a ton of options here but one thing you will not get is world-beating steak.

The place is marijuana-themed. I thought this was cute the first time I came here, since I'm from California, where it's virtually legal, and this was in Arizona, where Pot hadn't been legalized yet. (Although, the girl who made my food told me that AZ has recently legalized medicinal herbs, but that's a whole different story and review.)\n\nThe bread they use is baked fresh every day in a nearby bakery. Their ingredients are better than Subway or Quizno's, and their prices are moderately high, but well under 10 dollars, and completely worth it. Everything on the menu shares a name with a strain of marijuana, or something from pot culture. I liked that they're permanently unable to supply a sandwich known as \"Schwag,\" and their pork sandwich is called a 5-0.\n\nOther points of interest are their photos of Chong eating there, Kool-Aid on tap next to their soda fountains, and a huge mural covering a wall and a half depicting what appears to be Adam and Eve smoking blunts in Eden. Of course, there are stickers everywhere, flyers for raves and parties near the sandwich prep area, and really friendly staff. I honestly can't find anything wrong with this place, other than the fact that they're a lot harder to find outside of Arizona.\n\nThese are honestly among the best sandwiches I've ever eaten at a restaurant.

The portions are very very small and the prices are very very high. The wait staff is great, sometimes they forget things and need to ask them a few times but they eventually bring you the things you ask for.  The menu has changed since last time we came.  Was happy to see they have a few more apps, we did not get any as the waitress told us they were really small plates and not enough to share for the family - so we passed.  Also please beware the menu does not list all the ingredients in the food so if you have allergies please ask - for instance I really was looking forward to trying the Mac & Cheese,  I have had Mac & Cheese everywhere nothing was listed on the menu except Mac & Cheese which was the worse I have ever tasted.  Plus they put hot peppers and bacon it in, for me since I do not like pork when I ordered just plain Mac & Cheese I should have gotten it but they added stuff which is not listed on the menu which is why only a 3 star rating.\nThe price of the 6oz elk is a little high especially since a pound of elk sells for less than ten dollars so them charging close to forty for 6 oz does not make much sense money wise.  The decor is nice, some of the tables are way to close to together and you can feel like a sardine when it gets crowded.  I like sitting in the the small room with the fireplace better than the outside larger rooms it was a little nicer.\nThe tap water they put in the glasses is disgusting tasting, opt for the fuji bottled water. All the menus items can be changed to your liking so if you wanted something different you can get it sometimes without a charge sometimes with a charge.  All in All in was a delicious meal with just one or two problems and the food was good, the amount of food and the problem with the Mac & Cheese plus no one was willing to make an accommodation for the problem with the Mac & Cheese and I told two wait staff and my waiter and still nothing.

The sandwich had bacon turkey on a tomato bread. The tomato bread was interesting. They actually seemed to understand the rules of sandwich making. Which are :\n\n-Soft fillings should be served on soft breads.\n-Make sure there's a moisture barrier (i.e., something creamy or oily) between your -bread and wet ingredients (e.g., tomatoes).\n-Keep slippery ingredients away from each other.\n-Use a bread you'd be willing to eat on its own.\n \nThese are rather simple rules, but you would be surprised how often places don't understand them, and you get these sandwiches that one bite caused everything to poop out the back. The point of a sandwich is supposed to be that you can eat it easily while doing other things and not had stuff all over your hands. If the sandwich can't do that, it has failed in it's purpose of sandwichness!!! \n\nThe sandwich was almost made quickly and efficiently.

F&E's ready-made meal selections are pretty extensive AND are very yummy.  I freeze them too, they keep just as well in the freezer for about a week.  Not sure if I'm breaking any rules by doing that, but whoopie it works for me! \n\nI love love love their Greek yogurt.  I'm pretty sure that F&E yogurt is NOT healthy, can't be.  Nothing that tastes that darn good could be.  It takes 45+ minutes to cook brown rice, the fresh and easy ready-made brown rice is fantastically delicious AND takes 90 seconds to prepare.\n\nI shop around and I also find that prices in F&E are often cheaper than they are at the big box stores, especially Fry's.  \n\nThis store is always clean and is a great place to pick up your groceries.", "type": "review", "business_id": "thlCF7B2DIhkOuyQXj6liw"}

Not like this place is still a secret, which is a good thing because hopefully that means it's not going anywhere. \n\nI should mention that I can't normally eat a lot of food in one sitting. But something magical happens to my stomach when I walk into Carolina's. I'm suddenly able to put away twice the amount of food as my male dining companions. The problem is, I can't ever decide whether to get the bean and cheese burrito or the red machaca burrito, so I just end up getting both. And finishing both. And it's not even difficult! \n\nThese have to be two of the best burritos in the history of the world, and I'm sure a lot of it has to do with the ridiculously delicious tortillas they make here. I always pick up a dozen to take back with me to NYC, just to show people here that good Mexican DOES exist! It's just all, sadly, located in slightly shady parts of Phoenix (or in SoCal, or in actual Mexico). \n\nThe wait to order is never very long, but the wait to get your food does seem endless. It's only because they make everything fresh to order, though! And it probably just feels like an eternity because I've really been waiting several MONTHS to eat this food, and that's just added to the 5-10 minute wait for the food to arrive. \n\nThey have something here that I have never seen before...a Coke fountain AND a Pepsi fountain! And a smaller fountain with ok-tasting horchata and other Mexican refrescas. So no more fighting over whether a place is Coke or Pepsi, they've got it all covered. \n\nI could probably write several essays' worth of love for this place, but I'll save you all the time-just get off your butt and get to Carolina's ASAP! And if you're heading to NYC, bring me some tortillas! :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "d52zg-S0o940WUCK-nNiKw"}

They also doused the entire thing with about a quart of Russian Dressing (#5), put some fancy tomatoes on the sandwich and I requested a change of cheese from baby swiss to Smoked cheddar. You can only get about 8 different cheeses here on your sandwich (the rest you must buy) and they only carry one style of Boars Head turkey. No pepper or pastrami style, nothing but boring old plain turkey. Whoever is raving about the macaroni salad must be a rookie as well. The mac salad lacked any flavor and resembled ones you will find in a supermarket tub. There might be some better sandwich combinations out there on their extremly cluttered back wall (it's actually not cute cause your menu is in 20 places), but with the limited variety of meats, it doesn't mean much.

In this case we did not use priceline- just a group code so we were in the very corner of the terrace building with a view of the street.  The room was nice and the bed very comfortable, there were quite a few stains on the carpet though and my standard bathtub at home is larger than the tub in the room.\n\nI think priceline and the rooms at the local casinos have spoiled me!

There are a lot of pools on the property, I thought the Catalina pool which is all tile was the coolest, it has a fountain that separates the kid's side which is shallow (think 50's).  The front desk said they call it the Marilyn Monroe pool because she always said that it was her favorite pool in the whole world.\n\nOther posters mentioned tours but we were not advised of one.  We went to the concierge and told them we wanted to learn more about this fabulous property so gave us a map and told us to wander, they even let us go into the \"history room\" which is a 2 story meeting room located on the 3rd floor with all of the history of the building of the property we thought that was the coolest! \n\nThe reunion was on the golf course next to the pro shop.

Many of us were wearing 18th century french aristocrat costumes and were jovial, extremely high spirited, and looking forward to going into an event being held at this bar. Upon arrival, the patio-onlookers immediately began to try to get photos with us, the people at the door, and even security were cracking up and excited for us to be a part of their evening. This particular event had a relatively high cover price for some of our party-goers, and being that we were going to make up for any type of cover in many birthday drinks (we had spent an average of over $100 at each bar we went to this night), we felt it appropriate to simply ask if waiving the cover for out party would be alright. \n\nHere is where the first mistake was made - the door people claimed this \"had to be brought to the attention of the manager\". As a promoter myself, if a group of this many people come to your event together (especially those with particularly colorful personalities), you simply encourage their patronage in any way possible. 12 people have a lot of friends collectively...as a bar, you don't want to offend them. On top of this, we knew the party promoters personally and many of the people involved in this particular event, and we had made this clear in the very beginning.\n\nNow for the reason for the dreaded one-star review...the manager.\n\nThe manager was visibly irritated that he had been summoned. His first words to us: \"Why should I let you into my bar for free?\" At this point he had been made aware that this was a birthday entourage, but aside from that his comment was loud and intentionally insulting. We are not rude people and were in the midst of an extraordinary night out, so our response was not rude at all. We simply said, \"Well, there are 12 of us, we're going to be buying many, many birthday shots and drinks, and we know many of the people hosting this event. Plus, we look great! We're in costume and even your door personnel, security, and people on the patio are clamoring for us to come in.\" His response: \"I can't just let you in for free, what is it that you even do?\" It was obvious at this point that this man was rigid, humorless, rude, and beyond salvaging our acceptance of just paying the cover and going in (which was never even ruled out). So, we started just laughing at how offensive this man was being to us while he attempted to suggest we take our party elsewhere. He even went to the lengths of following us out and down the stairs of the public walkway, as if to insinuate that we had acted inappropriately and were being escorted.\n\nGypsy bar - if you read this, I hope it registers that someone felt treated so badly by your staff that they were compelled to take the time to write out a review on this site. I hope it also registers that your bar earned ONE out of FIVE stars on this site without the person writing it even having to set foot in the door. I would highly recommend this establishment to those who enjoy being insulted repeatedly and treated like a third-rate citizen. For those looking for friendly staff and a welcoming vibe, downtown Phoenix has a lot of options.", "type": "review", "business_id": "83da7v9gQsWJegTW52qnuw"}

I've been here a few times- the most recent time was to get stuff for my last minute Halloween costume. And they had it RIGGED up. They had these rather intimidating men in security vests (who were actually very nice) directing traffic flow into their lot. I got there at the right time- swung up, waited maybe 30 seconds for somebody to back out before pulling up and parking.\n\nThere is actually two parts to the store. On the west side is the costume rental side, and on the east side is the actual store itself, where you can purchase almost anything you want, if it's related to costumes, fancy dress and whatnot. \n\nService at this place is consistently pretty excellent. I've been during peak and off peak. During peak nobody bugs you if you don't want help, but they are more than willing to help you if you do. I was able to get in, get a white foundation, black eye cream, a powder and green spray on hair dye very quickly, with the girl's help. \n\nI went once ages ago as well, during off peak for extras as part of a cosplay outfit for a convention. The same thing- it was a lot quieter, but they were helpful when I wanted them to be, left me alone otherwise. \n\nThis place really is a gem. They have beautiful wigs, all quite a nice quality, pretty inexpensively priced. Their range of makeup is astounding, and they've got all the knick knacks you might possibly need for any outfit. I'm sure if you had a particular idea but possibly weren't sure how to execute, all you had to do would be ask your salesperson and they'd direct you and give you ideas. \n\nSince I plan to cosplay for a con again next year, I'd imagine I'll be in to get a wig and other accoutrements. The interwebs is good and all, but there's something to be said for being able to go to a store and see, right there, what is available.

It's also reasonably new. Up until a couple of months ago my office was a quarter mile from this place. I'd passed the sign a couple of times and gave it a shot one evening. Prior to trying TT2, I'd been a regular at Maharaja's Palace (pretty much on the diagonally opposite [SW] corner of 57th Ave), and if you like you can read my review of the latter to see why I won't eat there anymore.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food at TT2. It's a little more expensive but the food appears to be of higher quality. Basically the naan is the freshest/tastiest I've had in the US. Unfortunately they're light on beef dishes (probably because the moo cow is held in higher regard than people are back in India?) and I missed things like beef saag and vindaloo, but everything else is real good. They have \"chaat\" on the weekends - kinda like the Indian equivalent of Spanish tapas? - but there are several items on this particular menu that aren't available during the week and that's a bit strange.\n\nLunch specials are pretty good. There's a different main dish each day and they serve quite an acceptable portion of rice, that dish, salad and raita. Unfortunately most of the guys in my office are Phoenix-born and for some reason they consider Indian food to be anathema (I've literally gotten laughed at when I proposed this place once as a lunch destination) and thus I typically don't have too many lunch partners when I've eaten here. Then again these are the same guys who'll eat the most wretched Mexican slop I've ever gagged on in my life.. day after day, over and over and over.. but I digress..\n\nOne black mark against this place, they aren't open on Mondays. It's Monday today and I'd kill for some Indian for dinner so that totally sucks. Anywhere that isn't open 7 days a week really needs to reevaluate. Fortunately I can cook the stuff at home - that's when I have three hours to spare..\n\nSummary: It's far from the best Indian restaurant that I've eaten at, but it's the best in Phoenix that I've found (admittedly, I haven't tried anything on the east side YET.. *8-)", "type": "review", "business_id": "6VRbbNQe5ouWmwsMebUMkg"}

First: the folks who work there are totally non-judgmental. Doesn't matter how you dress or what you look like; they treat everyone who comes with respect and a positive attitude. That goes a long way with a working person like myself who doesn't try too hard to impress and often gets judged for not 'dressing the part' of success. When I travel it is often with juicers, boxes of veggies, a multitude of dogs or even collectibles. I really appreciate their fair treatment of each of us who stayed at this great location. Really super management model.\nThe place was beautiful to be in and at, clean and uplifting. The colors, textures, even the sunlight coming through the sheers and room dividers brought a smile to our faces. The grounds are well maintained, the people who work at the front desk, restaurants and even the maids are all polite and caring to each who need them. I couldn't ask for a nicer stay and will be sure to return only next time with a bunch of friends in tow to enjoy the suites. \nThanks so much for taking care of us!

I believe that Agritopia is one of the premiere developments in the state for everything you want in a neighborhood. As I write this, I hear birds chirping in the trees and can spot residents cycling through the streets, enjoying the meticulously landscaped neighborhood.\n\nWhen I first ventured out to Gilbert, nearly 4 years ago, I drove by Agritopia and immediately thought, \"This is a neighborhood from Desperate Housewives.\" Turns out, I was wrong. Dead wrong. I told myself that I could never live in a neighborhood that seemed like it was nothing more that a clean, pristine facade. However, nearly a year ago I moved into the neighborhood, and it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Here's why:\n\nLocation: Direct access to the Loop 202 makes it easy to get anywhere in the Valley in about 30 minutes. Also nearby is San Tan Village Mall. The mall is growing and developing into a nice outdoor mall with mid-range to upscale shops.\n\nNeighborhood: The neighborhood is beautiful and very well planned out. There are many styles of houses with differing floor plans. There's a home that is the right size for anyone. My parents have a single story, with a basement that is perfect for entertaining; while my wife and I have a small, two-story cottage, that is the perfect starter home for us. Agritopia boasts the smallest two-way streets in the Valley, to help promote pedestrian walkways and reduce the heat island effect within the neighborhood. Given the narrow streets, all homes are equipped with emergency sprinkler systems, reducing homeowner's insurance. \nThere is also a nice community center that is optimal for hosting small events (my wife and I had a wedding shower there, and the community has neighborhood events throughout the year). Not to mention the fitness room with workout equipment, and a nice pool that is even heated in the winter months. \nThe beautiful homes have front doors that face each other and promote social activity in front of the homes with neighbors. This is the optimal way to get to know who lives near you and build lasting relationships, which promotes a true sense of community. \n\nAttractions: Keeping with the sense that this land was once a farm lives on for those in the neighborhood. There is a community garden where residents can have their own plot of land to plant, grow and harvest their own crops. (Also promoting sustainability!) There is also a commercial farm which supplies produce to the nearby Joe's Farm Grill and Liberty Market. Joe's Farm Grill is the popular restaurant built from the Johnston's old home. You may have seen them on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. This is a great lunch spot! Also, there is The Coffee Shop. Located in an old tractor covering, this coffee house has specialty espresso drinks and pastries. Jessica Cuff, owner, was on Cupcake Wars and took home 1st place for her delicious treats. The farm at Agritopia has a farm stand where the fresh, local, organic produce is available for purchase at extremely reasonable prices.\n\nKeep an eye out for this becoming THE PLACE to be in Arizona. Plans for an assisted living development are in the works to break ground this spring/summer. Also, the commercial corner (named the EpiCenter) is in planning stages. This will bring artisan products and establishments to the corner promoting local businesses, walkability, and gourmet food/drink.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IrICJMK0sIzgTH_FUImihA"}

As a guy who's eaten at a lot of fast food restaurants over the years, I can say this without question. I used to eat their scrumptious chicken nuggets at their old location at Metrocenter mall when I was little, and I have had a love for their food ever since. If you love chicken as much as I do, you will be hard-pressed to find a better recipe. They know how to prepare chicken better than anyone. The use of peanut oil to fry their chicken makes it healthier and much less greasy than their competitors. Throw in a fantastic mix of herbs and spices, incredible waffle fries, a wide variety of condiments, and homemade lemonade, and you have yourself the most fantastic meal you'll ever get at a fast food establishment. Whether you go for one of their sandwiches, the nuggets, or the breakfast items, the chicken is without equal. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!", "type": "review", "business_id": "DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA"}

The atmosphere is very nice with good decor.  We were greeted by a friendly hostess who seated us right away.  Our waitress was helpful and attentive.  But the food was not good.  I ordered the tofu veggie sizzling platter and the menu said it was seasonal veggies.  I did ask for asparagus.  If I had not done that, I would have had carrot shreds, onions, green onions, some sort of bean, and that was it.  No other color or veggies.  Very drab and what little asparagus I got, they charged me an extra $2.  Very disappointing dish, with too much salt and heavy flavorings.  The tofu was steamed by itself and had no flavor as well.  usually tofu will take on the flavor of whatever it is cooked with.\nMy husband had the sweet and sour chicken which he found to be very boring and bland.  Our salads before the meal was a non event as well.  The cucumbers were in a state of being overdone and mushy, mixed in with ones that were too ripe.  The sauce was way too sweet and my husbands salad was not worth mentioning as well.\nWe will not return there.  If we want good Asian food we will go to Flo's next time.\nI will say the outside patio looked very attractive with cushions on the seats and neat flames for atmosphere.  \nWish the food was better, because the decor is well done and attractive.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UW32rmopWuDpT0X1b4RUXA"}

Also, checking in with FourSquare got a us a deal! ) \n\nWe ended up going a little later (8ish) so there wasnt a wait or a crowd at all which was nice because the venue is a little smaller. The bartender was very friendly, our serve was a little distracted and took a little longer to respond to our needs but she was very nice.\n\nWe both had wine, the \"single glass\" serving is actually 2 glasses in case you are torn between splitting a bottle for $20 or just buying a glass for $6.  I recommend the Falling Star Cab, it was full bodied and very yummy. The other wine we tried was the Hob Nob Pinot Noir. It was great, it had a delicious combination of earthy and sweet tones to it. (I am not very good with wine lingo, but those are my unofficial terms that make sense to me.)\n\nNeither of us were very hungry but we wanted to sample the fare so we could at least see if we wanted to come back. We got to choose either a free humus or a dessert because of my deal for checking in on FourSquare (POWER NERD! I know.) I really wanted to try the mango sorbet but we opted for the chickpea hummus and roti bread. For those of you, like me, who aren't sure what roti bread is- its much lighter than pita bread and a little thinner than a tortilla. Its very tasty. The hummus was very good, and they garnished it with diced tomatoes, onions and cilantro which i loved!\n\nWe also ordered the seared eggplant. It was AWESOME. It was a large slab of eggplant with a black sauce that was herby (thats a technical term in case you were wondering). They also served the egglplant with a yellow sauce drizzled on the plate which was sweet and very good, in addition to a small scoop of a red chili sauce (our waitress told me the name and I couldnt remember it for the life of me) which was spicy...I really loved this sauce it was the perfect amount of spice for the eggplant. \n\nI will be going back here to try the curry and some of the other things on the menu i cant pronounce. \n\nThere are a LOT of vegetarian/vegan dishes clearly marked on the menu. Their menu also boasts that everything, except for 9 or 10 items, is completely Gluten free.\n\nGood experience, definitely looking forward to trying it again for a full meal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3GAPcBG8SowgrpS6UHlDeQ"}

We try different things; a lot of it palatable, most of it good and some of it great.  But when you enjoy a meal that is truly superb, in every sense of the word, it sticks with you.  \n\nSuperb describes our recent experience at Distrito in Old Town Scottsdale.  Located inside the toney Saguaro Hotel (hipster haven and loved it!), Distrito is a lone outpost, holding down the fort in far flung Arizona, leagues from its' Garces Group cousins back east.  I was surprised to learn that Garces Group, which apparently has a stronghold in the Philadelphia and Atlantic City food scenes, has a few outliers here in the Southwest; Distrito & Old Town Whiskey at The Saguaro in Scottsdale and Tonto & El Jefe in the swanky Saguaro Hotel in Palm Springs.  Personally, I'm a big fan of indie & local, but I also think there's  a place for regional chainlets to show their colors.  Garces Croup's Distrito does just that.\n\nOur meal at Distrito was my freshman introduction to the Gacrces Group and man, it made a great first impression on me!  The menu is chock full of small plates and sharing options (as well as as full meals), so we took a snacky approach to dinner.  My other half and I wanted to sample a variety of items from the menu and agreed we'd get more bang for our buck by going micro, rather than limiting ourselves to just an app and a main course.  I'm glad we did!\n\nWe started off with the guacamole; a tell-tale bell weather of how the rest of the meal might go at any restaurant, and we were more than delighted with the fresh, hand-hacked guac, dusted with fresh cotija cheese and delicious chips.  We decided to splurge a bit and added the fresh crab (only $5!!!) and didn't regret it for one second. The crab was so fresh, I'd swear we were dining on the beach in the Chesapeake Bay (except we'd never get avocados that fresh in MD), so we were thrilled with the bi-coastal combo!\n\nMoving onto the \"Snacks\" or Antojitos section, we split an order of Rellenitos.  A clever twist on the classic \"Chile Relleno\", this bad boy was served sliced , each piece breaded and fried to perfection with the tastiest smoked tomato sofrito I've ever had the pleasure of spooning past my lips.  150% scrumptious!\n\nMy other half scarfed Pescado Tacos after the server told him the fish of the day (the species escapes me now) that constituted the fish tacos.  Divine!  We then each split Small Plates of Queso Fundido (with a savory Duck Barbacoa) and Chilpachole de Mariscos; a spicy seafood stew.  My boif loved the Queso (I'm not a huge fan of duck, but it was very tasty) and I laid quick waste to the bowl of Chilpachole,which was chock full of fresh mussels, clams and hand-made masa dumplings.  The stew sauce alone is incomparable and I've been craving a return visit since we ate there, even if just for this dish alone!\n\nRounding out the extraordinary (and I do not use that word lightly!  This meal was EXTRA-ordinary), I give big props to the staff and service of Distrito Scottsdale.  Our server was adorable, knowledgeable, friendly and quick as a flash with food, drink refills and answering questions for us.  The General Manager Niels even stopped by our table to chat with us, check on everything and make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  That is rare in this day and age and I appreciate the personalized attention, brief and non-intrusive conversation and approachability.  I told him we'd be back and I stay true to my promises.\n\nApparently Distrito has a revamped menu and is remodeling inside.  If there were one thing I would take points off for, it would and could only be the d\u00e9cor -- in that I was facing a blank wall during dinner. Considering that my attention was fully focused on the fantastic food, savory servings and the company of my adorable other half, I barely even noticed the walls!\n\nI'd like to go back to Distrito soon (even if just for that Chilpachole seasfood stew!!!) and pace myself so I could try their Platos Fuertes (Large Plates) and dessert menu. We never even made it that far because we were STUFFED on apps and small plates. For 2 big boys to not reach dessert phase, you know the portions are generous and the servings substantial.  \n\nI'd also like to get a group together some time and give their Taco Bar a try.  It's $25 per person (min 2 peeps) and features an assortment of tasty Latino fare that I'm sure would knock my socks off -- if it's anything like the meal we experienced 2 weeks ago at Distrito in Old Town Scottsdale inside The Saguaro Hotel.

I would definitely go to other events held here, but probably not unless there was something specific.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TP4ibW_dRx-jIJM_Ytz22w"}

Trillium could be a much better place to live, but it is not. When I first toured the complex, it was a Saturday afternoon - the college kids were either drunken from their hangovers or working on picking up the next skank at the local bars. If you REALLY want to see this place in its true color, then you need to tour it at night after hours.\n\nThe proximity is close to ASU. The idiots are loud and obnoxious. The walls and windows are just not insulated enough to keep out their yelling, loud cars, and motorcycles. The only salvation is if you live on the 3rd floor and get lucky enough to have quiet individuals next to you and below you.\n\nParking needs its own paragraph. You will not be able to find a place to park if you own more than one car. You will be assigned one parking place. I've had college kids try to park in my parking place also. Forget finding another place to park though. They invite all 50 of their friends over for the weekend. Parking is simply out of the question here. So if you take the bus or don't own a car, this is the perfect place for you.\n\nThe grounds are reasonably maintained. Lately they've been doing less with the landscape and there's dog ---- just about everywhere you walk. Lighting is ok - could be better as it seems very dim when walking through the corridor to your apartment at night.\n\nThe apartments themselves are fairly spacious, but beware the cheapness! Cheap fixtures everywhere. Plastic countertops, pressed wood cabinets, poor insulation, stained carpets, and shoddy piping.\n\nThe maintenance people are nice, but they do not know what they are doing. If it's easy, they can fix it with no problem. If it's more complicated, it requires several visits. My washer didn't drain the water during the drain cycle for nearly three months. I told them the washer needed to be replaced. They danced around the issue during this time until I wrote a very demanding letter that was extremely firm. All the while, I was spending more in utility costs because my clothes had to be dried for hours.\n\nThe staff have absolutely no clue what they are doing. I always place rent checks, two of them, in an envelope with the statement and then seal it and deliver it personally to the person at the front desk. They lost one check, but not the other. I took the issue all the way up to the corporate office when they threatened to terminate my lease and made it seem like we had been the ones at fault for their mishandling of checks. Their corporate office explained there were several people handling the checks during the long journey back to the corporate office to be cashed. It IS NOT the tenant's fault if checks are lost or stolen by the office personnel.\n\n**An update to the above paragraph - after fighting with the office about the check and writing them another check (never do this especially if you have a carbon copy) they agreed to at least pay the stop payment on the check -$35. The corporate office explained this would be an \"instant\" credit. So I went in during my next month's rent payment and the front office said it would be on my next bil. Not very instant but I waited patiently for the next month. The next month came, and still no credit. I finally had to call the corporate office again and complain. Not one thing was done to compensate me for wasting my time and causing problems. The office crew and the business team at Trillium are absolutely INCOMPETENT. \n\nLease agreements are the worst. They will charge you $1,660 to terminate your lease instantly PLUS the incentives you have received. For example, they \"say\" the apartment I live in is really $1,155 a month, but they are giving me a \"discount\" and I only pay $932 a month. If you terminate, you must pay the $1,660 fee plus the difference of the discounted rate and the regular rate for all of the time you've been there. That's some pretty shady business practices.\n\nYou would be a great fit for this place if you are under the age of 25, act immaturely, like to get loud and drunk, don't have a car or take the bus, don't mind the noise, don't care about cheap crap in your apartment, enjoy the hassle of the maintenance crews and incompetent office personnel, and just really generally don't care.\n\nMy advice: DO NOT waste your money here. These apartments are already expensive and you certainly do not get what you pay for.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2tL3VT4jy84MmwhxOA96Qw"}

For beer and spirts, for example, they just have the most common top selling items and very little of the rare stuff.  For single malt Scotch, you're lucky if there's just a handful of independent bottlings on the shelf.  Virtually everything is distillery bottlings.\n\nWith beer, there's none of the rare items like the Scandanavian beers, the special releases from Lost Abbey and others, and nobody knows about both of these two products.  There are a few employees who can chat to some extent but it's obvious they don't have the actual tasting experience to give you an informed opinion of their own selection.\n\nCheckout is notoriously slow and they go way overboard in asking for ID, even when you're multiple decades above 21 in age.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RCc01aDaUvQ-sWfoalfjXA"}

Well, the new breakfast menu is nothing like that. I had trouble finding something that I actually WANTED to eat. Instead of three-egg omelets for $6.95, they now have one and a half or two egg frittatas for $7.95-- so they raised the prices and you're now getting even less food for the money.

And we saw this place so decided to walk in. \n\nBefore even hitting the door, I noticed an older couple leaving. They saw us, Urban people, and stared a little longer than my comfort level normally allows. I rolled my eyes as we entered.\n\nFirst thing was a nice blast of cold air. I liked that. The atmosphere was exactly what you would expect of a bakery cafe. Dark stained wood. No ceiling. And some upbeat trumpet based jazz playing, the volume turned up higher than normal. \n\nThe line was slightly long, but fast moving. When you first come in, there is a paper menu on the table, and unless you have great vision, with a hint of magnification attributes, I suggest you grab one. \n\nApparently, all their food is homegrown. Which gave me hope for a more delicious meal. But of course, this also drives the prices a little higher. When we got to the cashier, I ordered the Anaheim Scrambler. Which is described as scrambled eggs with bacon, cheese, tomato, and topped with avocado pieces. I got a large pre-made/homemade lemonade. Overall $10.00\n\nTaric got his food first after we sat down, and it took him eating a whole half a sandwich before I got my food... My plate certainly looked impressive. A standard helping of eggs. I cup of assorted fresh looking fruit. And two half slices of their own wheat bread. The eggs were fantastic, in my opinion. They were cooked perfectly. And the bacon and cheese was delicious as well. However the best part was the avocado! It enhanced the meal perfectly. The fruit was fresh. The lemonade good. The bread was a little dry, which was disappointing considering this was a bakery, and I expected fresh bread.\n\nIn the end, I was satisfied. The price matched the quality. Next time, during the colder seasons, I want to try their coffee. And their black tea, which according to Taric is the best black tea of all time!?!?!?!", "type": "review", "business_id": "aBjWR-Mol58GMsRAdz2Tjw"}

It looks super classy inside and the deco on both floors is amazing. The best part? It is waaaaaaaaaaay cheaper than it looks. We had $5 martinis (perfectly made), $9 pizzas and $8-11 sandwiches.\n\nLet me explain. The pizzas CANNOT be eaten by 1 person (and trust me, I can eat, and I refuse to not finish my plate). So, you HAVE to share this pizza, which makes it $4.50 per person and you end up REALLY FULL after eating 1/2 of it. The margarita and the quattro (4 cheese) were absolutely amazing: thing crust, fresh ingredients and lots of flavor.\n\nWe also all split onion strings and a cauliflower appetizers, so between 4 people it only came down to $3 per person for both appetizers.\n\nComplete success. Will definitely return and try their desserts. What an awesome place. Too bad I had to spend it with a douche next to me, but I made my best effort to focus on the food and the other people there, and my experience was still 4 starts-worthy (and that says a lot, cause the dude was a biiiiiig douche).", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

The first thing I noticed are the oysters - boom - right in front of you on display and labeled from location. After settling in, you start to get a 'San Francisco' type vibe in the atmosphere with the 40's music, white tiles, open kitchen, etc. (dare I say it - I know Bay Area natives will probably turn up their noses at that as they do for every thing else).\n\nYou absolutely cannot come here without getting the oysters, don't even think about it. Second, do you like crab? Well, they have a \"Warm jar of King Crab and butter with grilled bread\" - verbatim, that is what it says on the menu. I want to die eating a warm jar of king crab and butter, that is how good it was. Lastly, you have to get the frog legs. Don't be a wuss, sack up and eat them. They are delicious, super tender, and have an incredible Thai chili sauce. We ate everything family style, I recommend you do the same.\n\nTop all of it off with great service from our server Casey and you have a fantastic seafood dining experience in Phoenix.

We had a restaurant.com certificate for this place for quite some time so thought it was time to use it. We started with the Papa Rellena, which is a mashed potato ball stuffed with ground beef and raisins and deep fried. It came with a salsa on top with a side of a green dipping sauce. This was delicious and the potato was perfectly seasoned and light, didn't feel heavy at all. The green sauce was amazing, reminded me of a chimichurri sauce that you could put on anything!\n\nHubby got the Bistek a lo pobre, which was a grilled steak, served with white ricFrench fries and topped with fried bananas. Unfortunately, the steak was underwhelming and lacked seasoning and the rice was undercooked (it was pretty crunchy and inedible). Hubby did like the fries and the fried banana was good. \n\nI ordered the Arroz con pollo, which was a chicken thigh and drumstick served with cilantro fried rice. The good news was the cilantro fried rice which was very good and flavorful. The bad news was the chicken, it was obvious that the chicken was not cooked fresh. It seemed as though it was cooked earlier that day or even the day before and just heated up again and put on the plate. The skin was soggy and the meat didn't have as much flavor as I wanted it to have. Thank goodness for the green sauce cause that was the only way it made it worth eating.\n\nOur waiter, while nice, seemed scattered and spread too thin. There were not a lot of other tables and he seemed to only be serving ours and two others yet my hubby didn't get his drink refill and he didn't really check back with us after he brought our food. After we ordered our meal he came back and asked us if we wanted an appetizer and we mentioned that the papa rellena was our app, he seemed confused by that. At the end of our meal when the check came, he didn't deduct our restaurant.com certificate amount and our app wasn't listed. I'm not sure if he thought that by not charging us for the $8 app was going to offset our $25 off cert. It took a while for the staff to figure it out but it eventually came back correct. \n\nOverall, not sure if we will be back. While the app was good and the green sauce delicious, it doesn't seem worth making the 40min drive when neither of us were happy with our entrees. Too bad cause we had high hopes for this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EFJAVVBQQqftuqY5Wb3WtQ"}

The food is fine - like any other MacDonald's - but they have a tendency of getting orders wrong ... for me anyway and no, I do not ask for any kind of unreasonable custom order.\n\nI am putting my grievance here because the managers there just don't seem to care.  On several occasions this particular Micky D's has gotten my order wrong.  A nuisance at first but I was willing to let it go one time ... two times ... three times. \n\nAbout a month ago, I'd already lost track how many times they have gotten our order wrong.  I didn't have a receipt but I did call the manager because I wanted to let them know they should work on training employees about reviewing orders.  It has happened one too many times for me not to speak up.  She was apologetic and even tried to rectify the situation, \"Come by next time and I'll still let you get your order for free.  Tell them Corrinda said it was ok.\"  I was like, \"Whoa, that was awfully generous\" and thanked her.\n\nA couple of weeks later, I had to take my daughter to the ER for a scorpion bite.  This Micky D's is barely a block away so I sent the husband to get our dinner.  \"They forgot my McNuggets.\"  Well, this stressed out mamma with a screaming baby in the ER with the worst pain that anyone could possibly imagine was not going to take this sitting down.\n\nI drove back to the Micky D's with our order and receipt and asked to see the manager.  I told her about our most recent experience in addition to the missing McNuggets.  She was apologetic, saying her minimal, obligatory apology and sent me on my way.  She said something about just starting but that got me even more pissed off that she was defending getting orders wrong.  There's no excuse.  Don't even get me started on the fact that she hardly spoke English, which I believe may have contributed to her reticent behavior.  Come on now, at the managerial level, communication with customers is pretty vital I would think.\n\nI left flabbergasted that my money wasn't refunded - not even that it wasn't refunded but it wasn't even offered -  but I knew I had to take a breather because my daughter needed a mamma who was calm and collected.  No point in getting steaming mad.  \"You got your nuggets so just let it go!\" I told myself.  \n\nThe next day I decided to get our \"free breakfast\" because it was a hellish night before to get up early and make breakfast for everyone.  When I dropped Corrinda's name to the cashier and how she was going to comp my next order, she asked for a receipt, I said I didn't have one, and she was going to ask the manager what to do.  A minute later she came back and told me they couldn't give me the breakfast for free if there was no receipt.  I told her get the manager out here so I can explain.  She goes to the back again and comes back out a couple minutes later and says that the manager approved.  Again, I wonder if this is a training issue because i would have expected for this  manager to come out and talk to me.\n\nThe restaurant itself is nice and there is a playground.  The food is fine - tastes like MacDonald's.  I will be coming here as little as possible for the sole fact that my orders have been incorrect on so many occasions that I've lost count.  The manager's don't seem to have a good handle on training their employees and the managers themselves don't seem to know how to handle customer issues.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QTBUIAFtdUx-YMcWaI3GiQ"}

It was just a few blocks up so we heel-toe expressed it over to our destination, enjoying the pre-nightclub streets of the Dale and a spectacular show of color from the Arizona sunset. The sky oozed romance with reds and yellows flowing overhead guiding us to what was building to be a nice romantic evening out.\n\nMedizona is located inbetween Old Town and Fashion Square Mall on the East side of Scottsdale Road. It is slightly buried in an older office area and the building itself seems to be a pastiche of what used to be multiple office suites repurposed for the culinary experience. The setting is subdued with low lighting and minimal decoration. There is a large room to the right that seems to be more for nightclub action, though we were there too early to see any such action.\n\nWe were waited on by a very comforting and professional gentleman who had the air of being the owner or manager. We choose a couple of glasses of Shiraz from Annies Barn and it was suggested we go with the sampler starter which consisted of a Rabbit Fig Baklava, Lamb in and Eggplant Taco, and Grilled Shrimp with Risotto. The Lamb and the Shrimp were tasty though not quite spectacular. I have a feeling that sampling them all together diluted the experience. I would recommend going 2 times and trying them seperatly. I say 2 times because the Rabbit Fig Baklava is not worth its own trip. The sweetness of the Fig here is out of place and conjours the flavor of a Grape Tootsie Roll Pop, which is not a good flavor for a rabbit dish.\n\nFor the entrees I chose the Lamb as I am always curious to see another take on a classic dish and my girlfriend went with the Salmon which we were told was going to be a featured dish in the upcoming issue of Gourmet Magazine. Both dishes were very good and I would recommend either to anyone anytime.\n\nMy overall take on Medizona is that its a very nice restaurant with a different take on things - crossing Mediteranian with Southwestern dishes - and I would recommend it for both romantic and small group dinners. The themes create a unique and memoriable experience without being too overdone or cliche.", "type": "review", "business_id": "81a6sTDzNzsRsoUETeoBRA"}

The Groupon described this place as an upscale Mexican restaurant.  We sat down to an assorted chips variety of banana chips, blue corn tortilla, and regular tortilla chips.  There were 4 different salsas to go with it.  I was impressed with the banana chips thrown into the basket.\n\nWe ordered chicken enchiladas, vegetarian cheese enchiladas, and grilled fish tacos with rice and beans.  The enchiladas were quite a big portion, but they had unique flavors that I could not figure out.  My dish was the fish taco and it was the best fish taco I have ever had!  It was lightly seasoned with chipotle sauce and lime vinagrette.  It was the perfect size for 1 person.  I think some of their other portions like the enchiladas can be shared, or you will have take home food.\n\nThe ambiance was very modern and lively.  The service was great.  My only negative that may give this a 4-star instead of 5-star is that the menu is somewhat limited.  I am not a big fan of pork, and many of the dishes I would have ordered would have had something like scallops and pork belly.

The areas are clearly marked, well organized, easy to shop, and have a decent amount of variety in each section. There's lots of parking outside, and if the registers are well-staffed, you've got plenty of checkout options.\n\nWhat I don't like:\nThrifting is really hit or miss, but it was all miss. It looks like it's pretty picked over, so I was left with a dog from every town. While the clothing section was okay, the other sections aren't quite as well organized. Sure, it's tough to organize things when they're all one-of-a-kind, but it was a touch cluttered. I don't worry too much about that--this is thrift store shopping, after all--but it only takes a few extra minutes to tidy it up.\n\nWhat I'm indifferent about:\nPricing. They do have that color-coded discount thing going on, so you can save some bucks depending on the week. That's kinda cool. But on the daily, it's pretty much what you'd expect to pay. Cheap, which I love. But not any cheaper than other thrift stores. Also, they have a little bit of everything, but nothing that got me wowed.

I went for the burrata--which I could have just sustained myself on that. The house-made soft cheese was the perfect texture and not too salty. The scoop they give is plenty split between 3-4 people with the accompanying crostinis. I tried two different pizzas: one with mushroom and Schreiner's sausage, the other was \"The Casanova\" _ prosciutto, dates, ricotta and arugula. I never thought of dates on pizza but I'm a believer. The dates' sweetness combined with the prosciutto is almost heaven-sent. I liked that much better and would fight off anyone who tried to take my share. I know it may be kind of sucky that their pizzas are only available in one size. But hey, that means you get leftovers of some really fantastic pizza.\n\nThe vibe is definitely a cross of hipster and white-collar work crowd.

The resort itself is absolutely stunning!! The grounds are very well kept and the staff is very friendly and helpful.\n\nThe wedding was held on the golf course and made for an amazing view of the mountains and sunset (which was perfect for this 530 wedding). The area where the reception took place was right below the main restaurant/bar for the resort. the area provided was small but perfect for the amount of people attending (they may have a separate location for bigger parties) there was plenty of room on the dance floor for us to all get-down and boogie! \n\nThe resort also catered the food and I must say I was very impressed. AS the guests of the party entered the reception area we were greeted with smiles by two young ladies serving finger foods as appetizers. There was a try of baby bruschetta, and crape wrapped asparagus sprinkled with asiago cheese. Both were very good but I must say to the restaurant manager... if this asparagus isn't on your normal menu it should be and ASAP! They were Delicious and everyone really enjoyed them!! For dinner we had the option of a steak which came with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus or salmon that came with a side of rice pilaf and asparagus. I was lucky enough to try both options and personally i would always pick salmon of steak but this time around I enjoyed the steak much more! My steak was cooked just perfectly but i did hear other guests say there's was a little rare for their liking (I didn't mind it at all). \n\nalthough I didn't have took much connection with much of the staff the ones that were working this party we all extremely nice and helpful! \n\nall in all i would defiantly recommend this location to throw and large corporate event or wedding.

I'm talking working there for at least the 15-20 years that we've been going to this place.  That is kind of impressive, you know.\n\nSo, what to order?  Well, if your idea of a Sunday afternoon (when we usually go) is to have a nice lunch and then have a functional, productive afternoon... don't eat here!  It doesn't really matter what you order.  99% of the time what you will be served is an elliptical plate with a 24\" major diameter that is chock full of greasyass refried beans, brown (aka Mexican) rice, and some other main dish that is covered in creamy salsa, cheese, or both!  \n\nI'm not saying it's bad (yes, it's bad for you) tasting, because it is actually quite tasty.. but, you 100% of the time regret ordering these dishes because of how you feel afterwards.  You're just bound to feel like a pig... heck, just wear your stretchy pants and one of those puffy blouses (gals, they are in style now) that way you can hide the bulge that will be your bloated belly.  Sigh... this is why I just get the fajitas these days...\n\nThe staff is mostly Spanish speaking (fine with me) and so are the patrons of the restaurant.

They should have told me when I ordered that it was only sausage and cheese and if I wanted anything added to it. My wife's sandwich came without any condiment either and she had to go to the counter and ask for mayonnaise.

Clearly a scheme. \n\nThe most disturbing part about the visit was when my dog wouldn't eat the dog biscuit the vet tried to give her.

She said \"Well, dogs eat anything, they even eat out of the trash.\"  and \"It's real cheese.\" wow. Her only valid justification was \"dogs need positive reinforcement after a visit\" which I completely agree with. BUT, you couldn't find a more suitable option for a treat? \n\nAfter speaking with the manager of the store, Brenda, I was told that they use Cheese Whiz as a distraction and treat for dogs because they like it so much. Well, yeah, I'm sure they would like a Whopper and fries too, but clearly that wouldn't be the best option for them. When I asked her if she would recommend Cheese Whiz as a healthy treat for dogs, she said, \"Well, no, but a little bit doesn't hurt.\" \n\nI highly doubt any veterinarian elsewhere would recommend Cheese Whiz as a suitable treat for dogs. \n\nNeedless to say, I am not giving Banfield any more of my service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8z6So-uKgZf4a4LOf3pPKg"}

(:-\\) no bueno!\n\n\n\nPadre's you want to play yourself off as semi upscale mexican restaurant charging 15$ for 3 small tacos. service and atmosphere isn't deserving of your priceing. at least put my PBR in a glass instead of serving it to me in a can.\n\n\nin conclusion, i will give Padres another shot. but i am in no hurry to return.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6nseTZb6WrGWcithRThfag"}

They have an open kitchen area which can be fun if you like to watch the food being prepared, however I found it odd that while I saw food being prepared I didn't smell anything. I am used to walking by a restaurant and being tempted to enter because of the delicious smell of the food they being prepared there. I went to the counter and ordered the orange chicken they seem to be famous for. The total was $6.82 which seemed reasonable. I sat down and was quickly served in a matter of a few short minutes.  My dish was served on an oval shaped platter. The orange chicken was on one side and the other side was a large helping of white rice. The dish had large pieces of chicken sitting in a large pool of orange sauce. The orange sauce had many pieces of red pepper flakes and other spices I couldn't identify. There were five or six large red and black peppers to add some spice to the dish. The chicken was not over breaded like you might expect from places like Panda Express, but the sauce was overly sweet. The sauce seemed to have a thicker consistency to it like a syrup. The five or six large peppers were a welcomed relief from the sweetness of the dish but they ran out fast. The spices and pepper flakes in the sauce didn't translate into flavor on my tongue. Im usually a big fan of orange chicken but was very disappointed in it overall and would not order it again. The owner was there and seemed very friendly, thanking every customer as they left. I saw some other food being prepared as I left and I can tell they were making an honest effort to make good food here. I saw that they were roasting their own peanuts, for example, instead if just opening a package of ingredients and tossing it in the mix. Unfortunately, my experience today didn't equate to the dining experience I had hoped for. It was just way too sweet and lacking flavor.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sNuyncpQdcvfEpfZS-3Yew"}

Well worth the wait to enjoy al fresco dining on a beautiful patio. I thought the menu items overall were a tad pricey. So I decided to order the Hummus ($6) as an appetizer and the Italian Flatbread ($12) as an entree.\n\nThe Hummus had tomatoes, onions and I believe cucumber (it was really dark outside so I'm not sure about the cucumber) on top of the Hummus. An excellent combination of flavors. The best Hummus I have ever had. The Italian Sausage and Goat Cheese Flatbread was serviceable but I can't see myself ever ordering that again. The Sausage had a little kick to it but really didn't taste too great.\n\nI'm a little fuzzy as to whether the bread that the server asked if we wanted was free. Why would you ask a diner if you wanted free bread? So that kind of rubbed me the wrong way since it seemed like some covert upselling to me.

We arrived late on a Sunday morning, well after the crowd came through. When I sit down at any restaurant, I expect the wait staff to acknowledge me within a reasonable time. It took the waitress five minutes to even stop at the table, all the while checking in on the surrounding tables. Also, any time I visit a restaurant for the first time, I tell this to the staff, and ask for their recommendations on the menu. The waitress ignored these cues, and only asked what we wanted to eat.\n\nAfter the long wait for drinks to come, one of my dining friends realized that her glass was cracked. I'm not talking chipped at the rim, but a crack all the way down the glass. When we finally get the waitress to alert her of the situation, all she says is \"oh,\" picks up the glass, and walks away. Not even an apology for filling up a cracked glass in the first place.\n\nI ordered the kalua pork and hash for my meal. Let me be upfront, that my standards for kalua pork are imu style. I understand though, that in metropolitan Phoenix, this isn't possible. The kalua pork here was just not good. If L&L can do a decent kalua with liquid smoke, I'd rather go there.

A crepe egg is whipped egg whites with a crepe. Despite all the ingredients in the crepe it lacked flavor, it was literally bland, no seasoning at all. No amount or variety of hot sauce that was available on the table could salvage it. In addition, the crepe was this boring beige color which was fitting because the dish was boring as beige.\n\nMy friend ordered the \"BLT Supreme\" which normally comes on a 12 grain whole wheat toast with 6 slices of sugar cured bacon, lettuce, tomato, sliced avocado & mayo. However, she requested it to be on white toast instead. It came out with a side of seasoned potatoes. The bread came out burnt and too dry. The mayo was barely visible...it was pretty much inedible sandwich. Instead of returning the plate back to the kitchen, my friend just ate the BLT without the bread.\n\nMy other friend ordered the \"Eye Opener Combo\" which came with pancakes, 2 eggs and a few slices of bacon. It wasn't anything spectacular as that can be ordered just about anywhere.\n\nTo sum it all up, healthy food doesn't mean it should lack flavor, but that is exactly how this place was.

You need look no further than Quiessence, \"A Garden to Table Experience.\" As the BF pointed out, \"This is what Binkley's should aspire to be.\"\n\nThe philosophy of the restaurant centers around local and seasonal ingredients. Quiessence is a showcase for local growers such as McClendon's. The provenance of nearly every ingredient is noted with strong connections to Arizona. Chef Greg LaPrad's food is not only local, seasonal, sustainable and responsible, it's also delicious.  This is the kind of place that does Alice Waters proud.\n\nSince Quiessence depends upon the best seasonal ingredients, the menu changes nightly. The BF and I had the six-course tasting menu. The portion sizes were perfect and the wine pairings were good.\n\nAmuse Bouche:  As it should be, we were given a bite of apricot stuffed with local cheese and kissed by mint that left us wanting more.\n\nCourse 1: \"The Chef's Spread,\" a tasting of housemade salumi, terrines and cheese. It's nice to know the Quiessence Charcuterie and Salumi program grew out of the desire to use every bit of the animals purchased for the restaurant. The accompanying housemade carrot, zucchini and yellow squash pickles were delightful.\n\nCourse 2: Chilled salad of cantaloupe, Armenian Cucumber, tomato and housemade croutons in a yogurt and dill dressing. It's rare that I call a salad course fabulous. The BF and I are going to shamelessly steal the idea and replicate it for our next dinner party.\n\nCourse 3: Housemade gnocchi with pork ragut. My family on both sides traces its roots back to Italy, so I am picky with Italian food. Sous chef Anthony Andiario's handmade cheese-infused gnocchi were spectacular and the ragout was perfect. The bowl had been properly warmed to keep the dish at temperature while I luxuriated in it. Our server initially forgot to bring us the wine for this course, but it arrived about halfway through.\n \nCourse 4: Fried soft shell crab with zucchini. Neither the BF nor I like soft shell crab. However, this version was so perfectly prepared that we both savored every bite. The zucchini in a savory sauce was a perfect contrast to the seafood.\n\nCourse 5: Pork tenderloin with bean and mustard \"gruel.\" The pork was tasty and tender, but it was served fully pink in the center. We were fine with this, but some diners may not be as open-minded to rare pork. I liked the side dish, but the BF did not because it contained beans. The \"gruel\" was mondo ugly on the plate. Speaking of the plate, the tasting version came on a really awkward piece of china that curved up on one side to form a well for the gruel and then back down on the other side to create a small area for the pork slices. The plate felt crowded.\n\nUp to this point, dinner was utterly sublime and Quiessence was on its way to a perfect five star rating.  But then, alas, a star was lost with dessert.\n\nCourse 6: Sampling of cheesecake, pink grapefruit sorbet and chocolate \"torte\" with peach ice cream. These were classic \"chef's desserts;\" a cook made them but not someone with pastry skills. Chef Greg, please get yourself a pastry chef. With the access that your restaurant has to the freshest ingredients, your desserts should be a revelation. The best item was the pink grapefruit sorbet. It was tangy and refreshing and would have made a great intermezzo. The citrus zest cheesecake was okay, but a bit dense. The peach ice cream was fine. The chocolate \"torte,\" however, was an abomination. The BF theorizes the cake fell as it was grainy and lumpy. At first, I thought it was either supposed to be cheesecake or some sort of chocolate bread pudding. I confirmed with the server it was a \"torte.\" I cannot believe the kitchen allowed that mess to be served and it went back virtually untouched. The sad part is that was our final impression of the restaurant. Dessert cannot be an afterthought or lazy. The wine for this course was tawny and it did not complement the citrus flavors.  \n\nPutting the huge disappointment of dessert course aside, Quiessence was wonderful. We'll be back as this place would be a perfect showcase for guests or a special occasion. Next time we'll try the Brick Oven Table. It's a magical table outside in its own little cabana wrapped with mini white lights. It features an improvisational $95 pp eight-course meal that the chef and sous chef prepare for two to six people.\n\nQuiessence features a relaxed atmosphere. The interior is neutral and many of the decorative items appear to be from Marshall's. The environment is pleasant enough and does not distract from the food, which is the real star of the show.\n\nYour AMEX had best be prepared for a workout. The tab for the BF and I came to just over $310 with tax and tip. That included the $75 pp six-course tasting menu and the $40 pp wine pairings.\n\nPlease note that Quiessence is closed for the month of July.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-yxfBYGB6SEqszmxJxd97A"}

It is Korea's national dish, with a main vegetable ingredient such as napa cabbage.\n\nFrankly I was doubtful the Kimchee would be as good as I have got at some Korean restaurants, especially coming from a market.

We've never walked away hungry (and my husband could be a champion eater!!)  I guess the only caveat is we never have a to-go box of the delicious food to take home ; )\n\nAlso, if you like wine the owner has other bottles that aren't on his list and he prices them well...just need to ask!\n\nLatitude Eight is a gem in Downtown Chandler!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "mPGgxatANSPw9KbMluhXkA"}

This place was below mediocre first of all it had a very distinct smell in the whole restaurant and it was not a very appetizing one that's for sure. Secondly the server only came by twice once to get our order and the second time to bring out the food, she never bothered checking up on us or anything we actually had to flag someone else down just to get a refill. The food was ok I ordered two blueberry pancakes with an egg and bacon as well as a half order of the biscuits and gravy. The pancakes tasted as if they used a Bisquick mix and tossed in some unripe blueberries which was very disappointing because I usually LOVE pancakes out. The biscuits and gravy on the other hand were much better but still not good enough to bring me back . John had the country fried steak and gravy served with hashbrowns and eggs. He said the country fried steak itself wasn't bad but not his favorite, the hashbrowns despite having them topped with cheese, onions, peppers and jalapenos were very bland and needed a good dash of salt.

I have enjoyed Cafe Boa in the past, but it has been years. \n\nSo far we are off to a good start. The restaurant is decorated in soothing colors, clean and relaxing.\n\nThe server is very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. Wild Salmon with Basmati Rice and saut\u00e9ed veggies sounds great. Thanks!\n\nUh oooh! The tea is weak on tea on heavy on hibiscus or jasmine or dandelion, whatever they flavor it with. Oh, and did I mention it's empty...... and they aren't terribly busy and I'm sitting at the bar. \n\nTick-tock, Tick-tock...for as long as this is taking I'm concerned that my Salmon will be over cooked. It's not that busy people.\n\nTick-tock, Tick-tock...the wait staff must sense it, because they are leaning half way through the kitchen window looking for food. I guess this is why they have a decent beer and wine selection, gotta keep you happy during the wait. Too bad I'm only drinking iced tea. \n\nTick-tock, Tick-tock...as I sit and watch larger tables that came in after me being served their food. It's Salmon not rocket science.\n\nThe Salmon is a beautiful piece of fish and nearly perfectly cooked. The fish is great but I'm confused on where the chef was going with this dish. It has a \"corn relish\" on top that is really just corn. It all sits on top of a bed of rice and veggies. The veggies are nicely cooked but they have a Asian flavor that doesn't match the rest of the dish. \n\nWell, I was going to rate it a 3 star until I got my bill and saw they charged me $19.95 for that dish. Definitely not worth it.\n\nHi all,\n\nThe owners response to my original review is below. I did reply back to him directly, but I don't think it will be shown to all so I am adding my response here.Enjoy the reading.\n\n\n\nDear Scott,\n\nReally Scott?  \"Tea was full at all times, never empty as you stated\" You want to call me a liar? Not a good plan for salvaging relationships with potential customers. Trust me when I say it was empty....I know. \n\n\"we understand that you were by yourself\" This means there is only one dish to focus on, it's easy.\n\n\"the ticket time on the Grilled Salmon was not unreasonable\" If this is the case then why was the waiter appologizing for it and why were other tables of 3 people receiving their food before me? If the ticket time was appropriate in your judgement then it is likely that either the server failed to submit the order in  a timely manner or you have a IT/ticketing system issue. \n\n\"Your dish, as you stated, was perfectly cooked\" Yes the salmon was perfectly cooked and it was a georgeous pice of fish, but beyond the Salmon there was little flavor and what flavors there were, they did not blend together to make a satisfying dish. It was for this reason that the price was unreasonable. It was not a good dish.\n\n\"Perfect service and not even a 15% gratuity, really?\" Ohhh, I'm sorry you must have missed the part about the empty iced tea, long wait, other more complex orders for a larger group of people coming out before mine, a main dish that the flavors didn't blend well and ice tea that I didn't like. I am a tipper that over gives and you have to work hard to get less than 20%. That tip was an earned tip plus a generous donation considering the experience.\n\nYour response has helped solidify my 2 star rating of Cafe Boa.\n \nGary S.\n\nHi all,\n\nOne last update from me. I thought you might be interested in seeing the private note that the owner of Cafe Boa sent to me as a response to my last posting.\n\nCheers, \n\nGary S.\n\nFrom: Scott R. Owner\nTo: Gary S. \n\n\"I apologize for my following tone, but your response warrants the following:\nMy response isnt to make you change your rating, it really doesnt matter to me,  most normal people know when some reviews are legit and reasonable and some are just ridiculous and silly. We have thrived for 16+ years, no thanks to people like you. The fact of the matter is that your experience was Flawless, we serviced you with perfection,.. you were just looking to trash our establishment. Most of your comments above arent worth responding to, they are so silly.  We served you in a timely manner, albeit not as fast as you wanted, a high quality meal with friendly service and in return you sit there at our Bar during your entire meal, typing on Yelp any flaw you could find, wow, kinda sad, really. If you are a food critic, ok then I would understand, otherwise, get a life.\nWe will be here for another 16+ years, you can count on that.\"\n Hi all,\n\nDear Scott R.,\n\nUsing my full name in your public reponse is yet more proof of your poor ethical standards. So all reading please be aware that if Scott R. doesn't take well to your critical feedback that he will take your name from your credit card receipt and try to smear you online.

We were the first customers there.  We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip to begin with that was very good along with a martini. My husband ordered the rib eye steak and was informed it was marinated in some kind of a soy sauce and pineapple mixture.  In a reasonable amount of time our food was delivered to our table with a baked potato.  It was lacking butter but had a tbsp. of sour cream, chives and bacon bits.  It was definitely not warm (actually cold) but my husband and I ate it anyways.  Each entree comes with one side that is shown in the menu.  It is basically a la carte, no salad, soup or  bread which I have no problem with when the main entree is good!.  Next came the rib eye which my husband said did not taste good at all.  He did not care for the marinade but said even without it, the qualify of the steak was lacking.  He sent it back and ordered prime rib.  I had also ordered the prime rib and it was small, somewhat chewy and lacking in flavor.  When my prime rib was brought out by a girl that was not our waiter, she said oh, did you want horseradish?  I asked if it was creamed or raw to which she answered I do not know.  I asked her to bring out the horseradish and a side of sour cream in case it was very hot.  The so called horseradish had no horseradish in it and no flavor at all.   This was a first!   I ate about a 1/4 of it and decided that was enough.  My husband's prime rib was brought out about 20 minutes later,  a larger cut than mine although they just have one size, and it was very red and extremely rare.   He was never asked how he wanted his prime rib.  He was informed then that he could have ordered the rib eye without the marinade but this was never offered to him by the waiter or mentioned in the menu as an option.  He said it was just okay but was disappointed again.   I must say the waiter never returned to our table once my husband returned his food.  He avoided eye contact with us and did not return to ask how the food was, if it tasted good or if we needed anything else at that time.  At the end,  he asked if we wanted dessert and brought us the bill.

Croissants are one of those things I find tricky.  Most of them are terrible in these parts.  I went to the bakery next to Federal Pizza owned by the Coes hoping to find a good one.  The young man behind the counter told me that he believed the shop made them, but he had only been working there for 2 weeks and hadn't seen any made in that time.  I got on Yelp and since I didn't want to go out to Tempe to that apparently fabulous Essence Bakery, I decided to go to French Grocery.  I used to live around the corner from this place back in the day when it was a Circle K. (hey, that rhymed!)  I used to scrape together $1.50 in quarters and walk there to pick up smokes.  Yes, back in the 80s, cigarettes cost $1.50.....really.  But I digress.....I went into French Grocery and it seemed pretty bare bones.  The cheese case was tiny.  Like, you can get a better selection in the Safeway Deli... Many of them weren't even French.  But I was there for croissants.  I was going to a friend's house for coffee and thought these would make a nice accompaniment to the brew.  Wow.  What a complete disappointment.  I got 2 plain and two almond.  The almond ones were hollow where they should have had almond paste,  like the filling had melted out of them while baking.  We were left with the merest hint of flavor.  But the worst part?  The croissant dough was just bad.  Really bad.  I've lived in 2 cities with large Vietnamese populations and they are known for their excellent bakeries.  They were, after all, colonized by the French for a long time.  Anyway, I know my way around a great croissant and we didn't finish either kind.  The plain were just wrong.  Crusty like a biscuit, not flaky and buttery......dense and very dry.  It's almost as if they forgot to put the butter in the dough!  The consistency was so unlike that of a real croissant, they should take the French out of the name French Grocery.  Quelle disappointment.  I guess I'll have to continue my quest.  Also, they were way overpriced, even for a great croissant....Boo.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XFm8pUV58qOB7HbIGFLIrw"}

A friend of ours reserved a room for a promotion party, and we came here in anticipation of tasty pizza.  The party started with some crisp salad with a bottle of vinaigrette and garlic bread. Then, came the parade of pizzas.  The whole entire table was filled with various types of pizza to satisfy even the pickiest eater.  The pizza had a very thin crust, layered with various fresh ingredients such as ricotta, mozzarella, sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms.  The pizza sauce was robust and more paste-like (To prevent the pizza from getting soggy I'd imagine).  My favorite of the plethora of pizzas I tried was a lovely ricotta mushroom pizza with fresh mozzarella.  The only slight negative was that it was very easy for the pizza to get cold since the pizzas were so thin, which thus turned the cheese a little rubbery as it got cold. \n\nService was excellent despite having a large number of people to serve.  Drinks were refilled fairly promptly, and pizzas were served promptly after everyone had arrived.\n\nSince the pizza is thin, you can eat a ton of it before getting full.  I probably had twice the amount of pizza I normally would eat, both because of the tastiness of it and because of the actual pizza itself.  \n\nSo, if you're in the area and craving pizza, Grimaldi's is an excellent choice!", "type": "review", "business_id": "PjBeWzCOCveiPuF-xqUaoQ"}

Really glad we did- our meal was incredible. It's not a big place, but it has a fun atmosphere, decent sized bar, and lots of patio seating, which is nice starting this time of year. We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and received excellent service throughout the meal. Not a huge beer menu, but definitely a solid selection and good happy hour prices ($4/pint, $10/pitcher). \n\nA smaller menu with excellent choices makes me happy and that's what they offer. We started off with the prosciutto wrapped asparagus- really glad we did that. Grilled just right and drizzled with a sauce that is slightly sweet made it even better. \n\nI got the burger, my husband got the brisket sandwich and we traded halves. Both were very tasty. The actual burger itself was full flavor- my only suggestion was maybe a few less toppings. I like a burger topped with a few things, but this patty had so much flavor that I felt all the toppings almost took away from it. \n\nThe brisket sandwich was the big hit of the night. Great flavor in the meat, tender and juicy and enough slaw on top to give it a a nice tang and add texture. The buns on both sandwiches were excellent and high quality. \n\nWe had our little one with us and they have a pretty good kids menu, too. It's not listed on the actual menu- the server will rattle it off for you. Ours is a grilled cheese fiend and theirs was great- two kinds of cheese on 9 grain, served with grilled asparagus and fries. We actually asked them to substitute tomatoes for the fries, which they easily accommodated, and she plowed through the hole thing. Minus the asparagus- but that's on her, not Grassroots :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "3wLLf8wRqD1ZQowi9aZSoA"}

Don't enter from the street, because the woman behind the bar did not nicely tell me to see the hostess on the other side. Don't put yourself through that--just enter from the parking lot/patio side.\n\nHaving said that, the patio was gorgeous. There's a nice fire pit, lots of little seating areas, and gorgeous old trees and vines.\n\nThe service, on the other hand, was pretty terrible. The sweet, young hostess tried her best to get us served, but it was futile. We sat at a dirty table for 10 min. or so. Then sat another 15 before she got a waitress for us. Our meals came out in a timely manner, but we had to ask for more water, ask for the the wine menu, etc. We got so tired of waiting we decided against another round and dessert. What surprised me the most was that there seemed to be no one experienced supervising a really young staff. No one (like a manager or owner) came through to check on tables or apologize for the wait at the table and lack of service.\n\nThe food was a bit better. My girlfriend had the BLT and chips. The sandwich was large and a bit charred but she said it was great. I had the bruschetta. I highly recommend the spicy copa and pesto, which was excellent. I'd pass on the brie, apple and figs, as the figs were terribly bitter and the over-sauced bread quickly became soggy.\n\nThe wine and beer lists were reasonably priced for by the glass or bottle.\n\nWe're hoping they improve on service for our next visit.

This spot has a few thinga going for it IMHO.  One, they just remodeled and it's beautiful, but I'm going to miss the old portraits of movie stars they used to have hung up for art.  They had Albert Einstein with his incredible shock of hair, a personal favorite hero,  a young Ella Fitzgerald, Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn(Breakfast at Tiffany's).  These photographs really jazzed up the place, but the wallpaper, rugs and other furnishing need updated, so I guess the remodel was good.

I order the Jumbo Jack which hasn't changed since I ordered it back in 1985.  They did raise the price from a dollar(Bah humbug!  Now, I just order a 99\u00a2 hamburger for value.

They almost never mess up my order as they are careful to repeat the order if they don't understand me.  They are fast too.  My only request would be to find a way to clean up the  garbage can and grease bin out back.

I'm primarily a fan of the veggie hummus sandwich, the silver haze, but the white widow, with chicken, bacon and ranch dressing, is also quite good, though somewhat heavier.\n\nA few years ago this location was quite a bit smaller but the owners bought the store location next door, kicked out the wall, and created a much bigger eating space, as well as putting in a bar at the back which provides eaters, stoned or not stoned, with a variety of delicious beers, several of them locally brewed.\n\nAt one time you ordered your sandwich and then waited for your name to be called and walked up to the happy hippy group where the sandwiches came out of the toaster oven, to choose your toppings and experience some cheerful hippy vibe. However, last time I went in, they killed the back end process, with everything being ordered up front. I have to say, NOT a fan of that change, it makes Cheba seem overly corporate and chain like and misses exposing customers to that classic hippy culture with that back end discussion with the sandwich makers so owners of Cheba Hut, if you are listening, stop trying to be so process driven, the inefficiency of the sandwich making, with the two step process, is a key part of your culture, it is what makes Cheba Hut, Cheba Hut, so bring it back!

I may not know everything about pizza, but I know what I like, and Grimaldi's gets a solid 5 for the crust alone. That crispy slightly smokey taste is unmatched by any other pie I've had. Interesting array of toppings, but I'd advise keeping it relatively simple: you don't want to bury the goodness of that thin crust, and the price adds up quickly with additional stuff. Salads are nice and large: splitting one between 4 people isn't a problem. \n\nWith 6 frequently used springform pans in my own kitchen, you might guess I have some strong opinions on dessert, and you'd be right: Grimaldi's cheesecakes are across the board far sweeter than I go for in my own baking, but that works for me with some of their more boutique flavors (I tried Oreo and Caramel-something-or-other last time, those were nice), but too sweet for something basic like NY style. In all fairness, you'd hear the same complaint from me pretty much anywhere that serves cheesecake. Slices are definitely generous enough to split between two.\n\nServers are young, energetic and attentive. The place is a tad more crowded and loud than I typically care for, particular during the snowbird season, which is about all that keeps Grimaldi's from an overall 5 rating from me.

Throughout the course, ponds, streams, waterfalls, and fountains make this a very unusual desert course.\n\nIt makes for very interesting golf, and if you have a tendency to stray off line, very difficult. There are three nine hole courses that depending on the day, are combined for 18 holes.  All are very playable if the correct tees are selected, and range from red - 5100 to gold - 6700.  \n\nThe course is in great condition, and managed by Troon Golf.  They do a very good job, and keep the course in very good to excellent condition.  There is a driving range, and above average practice facilities.  It might be noted that the course is surrounded by homes, but they are very out of the way, and a player doesn't have to worry about hitting into them.  Pace of play varies, depending of course on what kind of group you have in front of you.  Usually you can finish between four and five hours, and usually there is a marshall on the course.\n\nBernard's is also very nice, and is a great place to relax after 18 holes. They have a snack bar,  full bar, and full service restaurant, so you have a wide range of choices. The service is fast, friendly and efficient.\n\nThe only downside was that several of the persons working in the pro shop were not very outgoing - very business like, but not very social.  \n\nHowever, all in all, a great experience, and I will make this one of my favorite courses in the valley.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1zPhQ3_jdmQTn9_--IbYLQ"}

The guy said hold on and said \"Can we take orders for pick up? She is trying to avoid room service.\" Wow... just wow. This hotel is in a great location in the middle of the action in Tempe on Mill St. If I cannot order as a hotel guest for pick up then I would rather go pick up next door on Mill St where there are so many restaurants! Sheesh. Get a clue, dude. You have lots of competition being on Mill St and you are questioning whether I can order or not?  If the conference didn't give me a hotel credit I would DEFININTELY NOT be giving you my business because of that. How does he know I'm trying to avoid room service anyways... Wow. When I went to pick up there was not a single person in the restaurant! It was an odd hour though at around 1500. Again, wow...  I just had to get that off my chest... now onto the food.... \n FOOD: It's mostly bar type food but they also do have other more expensive entrees too. \n1. Kobe Burger with provolone on a pretzel bun ($11) - choice of cheese and choice of side. I picked the fruit bowl which included fresh pineapple, cantaloupe, honey dew. Burger patty was huge! The food was actually really good. I enjoyed it but I couldn't swallow the service. \nPRICES: Average.\nCONCLUSION: I will likely avoid this place if I can since I will be criticized for not getting room service. My room is right by the restaurant so of course I'm going to walk! The burger was good but wasn't that good to tolerate that kind of service. Obviously the only reason they got stars is because of the food. Luckily, the hotel does have 2 other restaurant called Cabana Bar and Grill by the pool and Mission Grille.

The staff is extremely friendly and clearly love dogs, which is one of the most important things I look for in a doggy daycare.  And they give great baths.  As far as boarding, I will not leave my dog overnight at any daycare that does not have someone who is on site overnight in the event something happens.  Fido's always has someone stay the night, which gives me the peace of mind that I need when I'm traveling.  They also are picky about dogs who can stay there, which means that they screen out the aggressive dogs.  The only negative about this place is that it doesn't have any outdoor play areas, but given the heat around here, that fact doesn't impact my review and certainly won't keep me from going back.

We went there for lunch, and occasionally dinner.  The food was always great.  \n\nWithin a few years the food was... fine.  So we stopped going.  Every now and then we'd go to the bar - it was in the neighborhood and all.  And the dance floor could be fun, and if the DJ was ok that night, you could have a good time.  \n\nI hadn't been there in at least 6 years, but the other night I was back on that side of town and was in a crowd of folks who \"still wanted to do something\" but they weren't willing to really drive more than 5 minutes.  (They considered this totally reasonable by the way.  How in the world did I ever get out???)  So once folks started talking about where the nearest Denny's was, or how there was a NEW Village Inn they could try - I volunteered Lagerfields.  It took a few minutes - but they were convinced.  \n\nGood things about Lagerfields - 1) Full menu until 10pm.  After 10 you can still get deserts and most of their appetizers.  In this part of town that's big.  2) Because they are a restaurant during the day, it's never hard to find a table.  Well, that and because the crowds just aren't packing it in over there... 3) It wasn't a bad time.  There was a decent cover band the night we went.  Between sets they played some muzak that was pretty cool for the crowd - we sang along to a few good 80's tunes together.  \n\nSo, is this your destination location?  Heck no.  But, if you're ever in the area, and you have a group of friends that you just want to sit and talk with while in a bar setting, it's not the worse option in the area.  \n\nAnd it beats the heck out of Village Inn.", "type": "review", "business_id": "77tMP3nG9TH0rrhf6G4g6A"}

Saturday night date- I picked where I wanted to go. Crap! MISTAKE #1.  IPIC  sucked once again and this is the 3rd time I was there! I don't mind spending my dates bucks on high  priced things to do and eat- nor my own money for that matter ,if it means I  get to stay  in my neighborhood-Scottsdale but this IPIC theater  is such a rip off in more ways than one..Here me out! Honestly!\nWe buy the tickets for $54.... and I head for the  bathroom.  A huge line of women in the bathroom (which is gorgeous) BUT--..there is NO toilet tissue in the stalls! The crappiest thing about that is- the women coming OUT of the stalls do NOT say a fking word to the ones waiting in line to use the stalls. Really? And they are smiling! nasty bitches- ya have to wonder now- how clean those fancy loungers really are now with them sitting their un-wiped ass's on the movie seats now. Ok- here is what happens next.  Theater #7, Saturday night ,Feb 25th, 9:30pm  show. We find our seats and once the movie starts- our seats are vibrating like someone is kicking them from behind! I keep looking around and no one is in back of me...then, I realize it's the sound system! Now that is annoying to have to sit in a seat that is vibrating- NOT the good vibrating way (naughty people)  but super annoying way...Ok, next-The sound system was so messed up in this theater that  it actually became an annoyance to sit thru the rest of the movie being tortured by the bad BROKEN sound system that shoots out a high pitch every 5 minutes. Warning too- People that  must drink vino and alcohol in the movies and eat in the movies, are FAT slobs. Just saying the truth. They were making noises, the waiters are getting in the way of the movie screen and they are all  talking loudly cause they are DRUNKEN ass holes- and  then- the smell of their drunken  farts from them stuffing foods in their pie holes and drinking during the movie is disgusting. Hello Cine Capri- here I come-never again to be in the IPIC itty bitty theater of human gas bombs- bringing my own toilet paper  and jiggling in the sticky chairs form the nasty women who didn't wipe their %$#@ in the bathroom.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3SlKa69UVN8KKYYPtlz1ew"}

(I did have a friend tell me that one time only...he was left waiting at his table but that as soon as the waiter & manager found out they went out of their way to make up for the oversite.) \n- Food - Let them bring the bread!!  Save your \"non-carb\" moment for another time!  YUM!  The spinach salad is wonderful and big enought to split especially at lunch. (besides...you have the bread!) I've had a couple steaks and the prime rib, the fish and even dessert.  I swear I've never had bad food here.  Always \"meets or exceeds\" expectations. \n- Beverages:  OK selection of wine (see happy hour below).  The do have some high end wineries on the menu but I find they have good standard wines and throw in a few \"odd balls\" that you don't normally see on a mid priced menu so try one of those.  They do also have a full bar.\n- Atmosphere - can be a bit loud.  Especially if people do not remove the screaming children.  :-(  \n- Happy Hour - definately do the patio.  When it's chilly they have heaters and a big fireplace.  The sliders are a complete meal!  They also do (I assume they still do) 1/2 price bottles of wine on Mondays!!  \n\nSo...don't let the fact that it's a chain deter you.  Give them a try.

The atmosphere is always festive and it's just pricey enough to keep most of the unwanted college riff raff out. \n\nThe Bad: Stay away from the hummus - yuk - tasted like a chili dog last time I had it. They constantly mess with the pasta salad. Last time I was there they used balsamic vinegar in it, which didn't taste bad, but it's grey. Grey!? What kind of food is grey? It's just hard to look at.

Port of Subs was one of the few that cut the meat when you ordered. I'll miss that, but Silver Mine is close. They slice the meat fresh all day as part of the shifts. That means it's still very fresh. The quality of their meats and bread is great as well. Their bread is especially good. \n\nThe restaurant is clean - immaculate even. The employees are all really nice dudes. So friendly, I doubt they're even from here. They must be from the Midwest. \n\nThis place would probably deserve four stars like any other good sub joint should, but what sets this place apart is that they deliver until 3am. That's right - not only does this place deliver sandwiches, they're open until 3 mother-frenchin a-to the-m. \n\nTheir brownies are 430 calories and they worth - they worth hard. They carry a great selection of chips and bev, and since they are relatively new on the scene - they seem to be constantly tweaking the business here and there. Their menus get revised every time I order from them. They give away scratch cards that usually give you a free delivery or a free small side item or drink or something. I have yet to win a car or my own franchise, but they popped up all over town at some point recently. \n\nIf I did win my own sub shop, I'd change the tag line to \"You can't beat our meat\" because that's what the people would want.\n\nSeriously, these guys are cool and the food is good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "f9xITzdfPbqQUoBxmSNymQ"}

This place is a winner. \n\nMy only little piece of constructive criticism is about the frequent customer card. While it is awesome that they even offer it in the first place, the maximum value of your free 10th item is only $3.00. It would be nice if the value was more near the amount most customers spend on a typical visit. I find that my usual yogurt creation is in the $4.50-$5 range, and I'm thinking that's actually even lower than most people. I feel bad even bringing this up, because anything for free is better than nothing for free, but I think it is worth mentioning so some people aren't surprised when they fail to read the fine print before redeeming.\n\nEdit: I just received a very nice message from someone at Zoyo letting me know that the $3.00 maximum is just there for their protection and so people don't take advantage of the promotion. According to them, everyone has received their 10th yogurt for free so far, no matter what the weight has been. Good to know! I definitely appreciate the personal attention to my review.

Please don't get me wrong.. CT is a great hang out and is VERY well priced with huge portions but, quality over quantity is a sound rule that for my experience didn't hold true. \n\nWe sat for about 15 minutes before we're even acknowledged by our waiter.. I was so thirsty I almost took my chances and drank from the pool on the patio.. who knows what was in that water but I was SO ready to find out when our waiter showed. Once we got moving the service was decent though one of the entrees was nearly 10 behinds behind the rest. So of course we waited for that entree to come out while ours got cold so we could eat together. Pretty annoying though forgivable I suppose. What wasn't forgivable were the screaming kids that were playing around the pool as their stupid parents sat there and got drunk. How can you enjoy a meal when there are babies crying and children playing.. it seemed like fucking Romper Room instead of a TAVERN! *Sigh* I miss Lambchop!\n\nThe food.. eh.. so so. The Pork Adovada sauce was bitter to the point of needing to drown it in sour cream to take the edge off. Me personally would have sent it back but there were other powers that be. The Rotisserie Chicken wasn't better then something you can get at your local grocery, though Id have to say that the groceries are far more moist and flavorful. There were 2 standouts.. Habaero Cheeseburger and the Green Chile Mac 'n Cheese.. both very very tasty! \n\nWe will certainly come back here from time to time but there are other old reliables that make better New Mexican food in Scottsdale.", "type": "review", "business_id": "b5cEoKR8iQliq-yT2_O0LQ"}

Mulligan's 100% falls into the second category.\n\nWalk into Mulligans with reasonable expectations. This is a bar where you can have a good time with friends without being judged or really having a care in the world. There will always be those who are blacked out, those on a bar crawl, those on a bachelor/ette party, the out of towners, the day to night drinkers and the dive bar enthusiasts. The crowd is normally friendly and always a bit out there. Mulligans has a great selection of music and loops it in with the music videos or movie clips. While it lacks a legit dance floor, chances are, someone will create a pseudo dance floor and most of the times it results in dance party USA. Did I mention a random strip pole? I don't think I've ever seen it used by anyone but a drunk bachelorette. The drinks are stiff and cheap. The bar is centrally located in Old Town and you can easily bar hop from there. True to the Old Town dive bars, the regulars stumble in through the alley entrance. The patio is relatively small but it gets the job done.\n\nAll in all, you'll most likely always have a decent time here if you're looking for a drink-filled night out. Only on rare occasions will it be overly crowded and it makes for a great people watching experience.\n\nWord of warning: If you start a tab and pay with a card, they will hold $50 from your bank account for a couple of days after your visit. And this is every time you open and close a tab so let's say you pay for three drinks separately...$50 will be held from your account for each of those drinks.\n\n3.5 stars if yelp did a half star rating.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3g2ofV7mhEoPyfF7vFMObA"}

She ordered the pulled pork sandwich and I went for the same but Tennessee style (that's topped with slaw for y'all from from the south). David B. described the quality of food in relationship to the decor. Another indicator is the level of sloppiness. When I slowly opened the aluminum foil and saw the saucey/cole slaw mess, my expectations increased. The sandwich was of large size and presented a dilema for me and my dining partner (perhaps more for her as she was wearing a nice business suit) - do we dive in and end up wearing half it on our pants and shirt, or should we be civilized and use a knife and fork. Yes, the alternative would require both utensils. Given we had several work hours left in the day, we elected the later. The flavor was excellent. The saucy perfect and the slaw set it off just right. \n\nTwo large sandwiches and two medium drinks - just over $13.

Please keep in mind that my experience is only a reflection of a typical \"lunch rush\" Chico's environment - the atmosphere is probably different most other times of the day, but I imagine that my observations on the food will hold true regardless of the hour.\n\nA quick-talking girl at the counter will hustle and bustle you into making your order as speedily as possible, and will then hand you a slip of paper with your order number on it. We all know how this game goes - hang out, and wait for said number to be called. \n\nIf you need to be in-and-out quickly, this is a good time to fill up a few little plastic cups with salsa for the road - there is a salsa bar with probably 5 or 6 salsas to choose from, and there will be no salsa already included with your to-go order. I like the salsa bar...it's always clean and well-stocked, and all of the salsas have a good flavor.  Your order will include a meager serving of restaurant-made (but not quite warm and delicious) tortilla chips.\n\nI have ordered many things at Chico's, and, okay, I understand - it's a Mexican \"grilled\" platter, or the entree includes \"grilled' chicken, but does everything need to be blackened and charred and dry to the point of an unusual \"crunch\"? This is where that salsa we discussed earlier comes in. Doused in copious amount of salsa, it's not too bad, but I can't imagine straight-up muching on it without that extra step of preparation.\n\nThe rice is good. I can't comment on the beans, because I don't eat them!\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is cute - much nicer than your usual chain, reflete with wooden parrots and brightly-colored tiles.

However, Scottsdale is an international mecca for those seeking the flavors of the southwest, spas, art galleries, cowboy paraphernelia, and a very exciting night life.\nOld town is older than most would think...The Hohokam indians trafficked here until 1400 AD., 400 years later an army general named Scott bought acreage here, and the little hamlet blossomed by the early 1900s.  Many of the original buildings can still be seen in old town, including the blacksmith shop on 2nd and brown which is nearly a century old.  In the 1930s, the magnificent and indefatigable Frank Lloyd Wright came here to build Taliesin West, which is a must-see for anyone interested in architecture.\nIn the 1950s Scottsdale officially became a town, and you will notice many of  old town's buildings and eateries retaining the style and decor of that era.  One of those places is the Sugar Bowl, located on Scottsdale Road.  It's a mom and pop soda shop and ice cream parlor, where you can get dozens of flavors of malts and sodas, even peanut butter and jelly sandwhiches.\nOld towns streets are lined with souvenir shops, Native American jewelry stores, and many enchanting art galleries.  For those particularly intersted in the arts, coming to old town on a Thursday evening is worth it.  The art walk has local galleries opening its doors to pedestrians, some serving canapes and wine, some featuring the music of local artists.  Tucked inbetween the galleries you will find wonderful restaurants, bars, pubs and eateries.  My favorite restaurant, Malees, of which I already wrote an extensive review.\nIf Thai is not suitable to you, try Ra for sushi, or Bandera's across the street for their amazing rotisserie chicken, or venture over to Buca di Beppo for the traditional family style Italian dining.  \nFurther north are a plethora of clubs and bars:\nDos Gringos for a taste of Rocky Point during spring spreak, the Upper Deck for sports and live bands, The Comedy Spot for stand up comedy, Next for dancing and swilling, Devil's Martini for southwest meets Martha's Vineyard, Gilligans for the wheel of booze, wheel of fear factor, gold fish racing, or karaoke, Mickey's Hangover for the best happy hour in town, Martini Ranch for more live band entertainment (Sunday nights is Metalhead, the live act in town), Drinx for amazing martinis like the angel food cake, Myst for clubbing like there's no tomorrow, Axis/Radius with its two large dance floors, four bars, and plenty of dancers to entertain, Suede for great dancing and relaxing on the chaise lounges near the fire pit, Pussy Cat Lounge for awesome djs, and a packed bar every time, Crown Room  for dim lights and socializing, American Junkie for feeling like you're in college again, and finally - the polynesian tiki lounge by the name of Drift, with its awesome salt water tank and exciting drink menu.\nThough this is a comprehensive list, these are just some of the fabulous places that make old town a destination for old and young alike, regardless of interests, and personal pursuits.\nI love Scottsdale!", "type": "review", "business_id": "4gIV5MYpCDbNI-bL3g_tSw"}

Yelpers, once again you have not failed me. The rave reviews were spot on - this place is fantastic. \n\nBoyfriend and I snagged ourselves a comfy spot on a couch next to the firepit on the patio. The atmosphere is comfortable, romantic and warm. We were immediately greeted by our waitress who pointed out the happy hour menu. They have several drink options and many food options. We were there for the food and ordered a few items to share - the popovers (a must), the charcuterie plate, the burger and the truffle fries.\n\nHands down the standout of the night was the popovers. They were huge, fluffy, and full of eggy goodness. They are served with butter and salt - it's really all they need - yum! But I added in some of the meat from the charcuterie plate and it was an excellent combo if I do say so myself. Everyone who says get the popovers is right - get the popovers!\n\nThe burger was very tasty. A good size - plenty for sharing and cooked just right. The fries were my least favorite. I was excited by the description - truffle fries with parmesan cheese - but the fries were overcooked (too hard) and the truffle was overpowering. Not my thing I guess.\n\nThe service was really good too. Even though you'd spend WAY more on dinner inside I never felt like I was part of the cheap crowd. I felt like we were treated the same way we would be if we were dropping $200 even though we dropped less that $50. I appreciated that and it's smart because now I'm very likely to come back and blow a wad on a special occasion! Well played, BLT Steak!\n\n I highly recommend BLT Steak's happy hour. It was the dining highlight of my weekend.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RRGRruNX4o6689EB48z3-A"}

Over all, a comfortable place to have a quick meal.  For \"groups\" I answered no because it is a small place and the largest table I think sits about 4.  The only think that didn't work for me was the Hispanic music played in the background, but that is to be expected.  \n\nStaff: Friendly and helpful.  When he asked me if I wanted beans on my tostada, I said just a little and that's exactly what he did.  I even got extra cilantro and a few wedges of lime on the side.\n\nFood:  Very good.  The plate is full and appealing to the eye.  They use romain lettuce as well as iceberg which I was impressed with.  Seasoning and temperature of the food was good.  They use good quality plastic plates which I was impressed with.  However, the to-go container is a one size fits all.  They might want to get some small ones as well.\n\nPrice: Excellent.

Big mistake. 7 o'clock and they were packed! I couldn't believe it. We waited 20 mins for a table (which we didn't mind, we were in no rush). After getting our drinks, we ordered some guacamole and chips as our appetizer. We waited and waited, finally, like 20 minutes later watery guacamole (it looked like pea soup) and the WORST tortilla chips came out. The chips were so stale we couldn't finish our one bite they were also soaked in grease. We spit it out and told our waitress. She brought us new chips that were not much better, but edible. We kept the soupy guac, as we hated to complain...they were so busy we just blew that off. I got the bruschetta chicken pasta but asked for shrimp instead of chicken. I don't do dairy, so asked for no cheese. Waitress said no problem. Mom got a ribeye steak and shrimp with sweet potato fries. The food came after 35 minutes. My pasta with extra cheese. Ugh...and 4 of the rawest shrimp sitting on top. Sent it back because I can't eat cheese. Waitress brought a new one without cheese. I like my shrimp well done, or at least cooked to a healthy and safe temp. She brought the new pasta, it was ice cold. Then she took back the shrimp and left the pasta! So the cold pasta was left to get even colder while they fixed the shrimp. Then when she brought the shrimp they had to microwave my dinner to get it hot again...resulting in it being dryer than dry. Ekkk. Moms steak was served in a pool of butter and grease. Literally. She used all the napkins at the table to sop it all up. Some of her fries were wet and mushy from the butter. And the shrimp was missing from her plate! After asking several times they finally brought it. Nothing special. Just shrimp. We used a coupon buy one get on free. They charged us 6$ for my four raw shrimp. It was ridiculous. Yes, it was Christmas, but really? This experience should have been better. Even for Christmas night.

I love supporting small, family owned pizza joints. \nWhen I got my pie I was excited to get it home and try it. \n\nOne thing I do not like about pizza is when the crust is soft and chewy.   I like a crisp crust.  So a few weeks later I thought, \"Well maybe I just should have specified\" that I like it \"Well Done\"  so I thought I would try it again.  my order came to $12.50 for a pizza AND 10 wings.

If you are lucky, this is the person who will be making your drink(s), because he is one of the best bartenders in the valley. Future patrons would be wise to let him know what you like and leave the rest in his hands. \n\nThe patio is not only spacious and comfortable, but somehow shielded from the sounds of central avenue traffic.

Obviously being a bar, the main attraction are the libations being poured, but its important to have food that compliments the both the vibe and experience and Hula's achieves this with gusto. \n\nHighly recommend this place if you are in the central corridor looking to cool down on a hot afternoon or celebrating Friday night with your friends late night.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_FXql6eVhbM923RdCi94SA"}

The d\u00e9cor was minimal, everything was white and it seemed very well lit for a nightclub... less chances of ending your night with coyote ugly at this establishment.   There wasn't a cover charge and the drinks were... well I can't say if they were pricey because they were being paid for, but I can attest to their deliciousness.   I never had to wait in line for the bathrooms which were seemingly clean and also provided a bathroom attendant to hand you a towel... no toiletries though.  The staff was great, really cute bartenders that like to flirt.  The DJ was also a charmer and introduced himself to me.  He was playing a so/so music which basically consisted of top 40.  I can't really blame him though, I think it's a pretty common recipe to try to get people on the floor, which, by the way, was lifeless at this point but that didn't stop me, I grabbed a friend and danced the night away.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to any other Scottsdale skeptics.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4juYmq_YpvdV8HZ1r0AWBw"}

So in my research of finding restaurants that serve such this item I stumbled across Sakana.\n   From my first bite, I was in love.  The Hamachi lived up to its reputation!  A nice size piece of fish, grilled to perfection.  I devoured this dish and could ate about two more servings of this.  I also ordered some sushi pieces as well.  The sushi was standard issue.  It wasn't mindblowingly good, but it was not terrible.  It totally satiated my appetite.\n   The inside is a quaint and cute little place.  I'd say it would probable sit around 50 people.  The decor, is nothing too fancy, but it's not bland either, just the right mix.  They offered several different lunch specials and the portions were huge for the price.  Also they have two lists of special appetizers.  They have several items that are $.50 cents each if you order a bottle of Kirin beer.  And they have several items that are $1.00 each if you order a bottle of Kirin beer.  That's nice if you're curious to try something new.  What's an extra either 50 cents or a buck?\n   All in all, just go for the Hamachi Kama.  I will be back for sure just for this one item!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Bjt3rB73dvSDe1XEPEWc6w"}

It got busy, we got ignored for the better part of half an hour -- but then when we finally saw our new server he was very attentive going forward. Our food was delayed and we felt there was a lack of HONEST communication. Honest meaning don't tell me the food is coming right now then come out another 40 minutes later and tell me the same thing, just tell me how it is. Our server finally got a manager involved (Waylan - sp?) and let me tell you, he was our saving grace. He communicated the issue and was quick to fix it. It was to the point that we were talking about never going in again and he changed our minds. Our food came out after he got involved, it was great, everyone was super attentive to us (we weren't looking to be babied, that's now how I roll).  I know it's frustrating when something goes wrong and you don't have much control over it but you as a manager/server get the brunt of the angry guests.\n\nSo over all, my experience at this place has went from meh, to oh no never again, to great, thanks to the customer service provided by the management team. We'll be in again soon for a delicious beer  or five, and I will give Waylan a high five when I see him, and we'll ask to sit in Jake's section. :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

However, there was so much more on the menu that I seemed appetizing. The sweet tea came out in large jars. Nice! I had the 3 pc chicken and 2 waffles smothered in gravy and onions.

I prefer to have my car serviced at a dealer, and since this is the most convenient Ford dealer to me, I ended up at Five Star. My husband had taken my car there previously and had no complaints.\n\nI scheduled an appointment online...big mistake. I thought a 4 pm appointment would be perfect, especially after looking at what is done at a 40K maintenance appointment. Boy was I wrong. I arrived at the dealer (it was a bit confusing about where to go to actually get to the service area) and was told that the car would have to stay overnight because there is no way it would be done before they closed. Oh, and I found out the service area closes at 5 pm! 5 pm??? Are you kidding me? Maybe I was spoiled, but the Ford dealer I went to back in Columbus was open until midnight during the week for service appointments!\n\nSeeing as how leaving my car was not going to do, I was told I could go to another part of the dealership to see if the Quik Lane could handle my maintenance needs. No appointment necessary for Quik Lane, and they were able to get me right in. About thirty-five minutes and $31.44 later, I had a car that had a multi-point inspection performed, oil change, and fluids topped off. I am still baffled why the regular service area couldn't handle this, especially as I had an appointment, but c'est la vie. Next time my car needs to be serviced, I am only going to the Quik Lane at Five Star. Service was nice, prompt, and not at all expensive.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hO0ECg_jIA4iYMBLq3RVjw"}

However, after one bite, I was fully at ease with my decision.\n\nThe restaurant is situated in a hidden garden with a quaint dining room and a lushly enclosed courtyard.

Went on Saturday evening, had a lovely time drinking overpriced cocktails outside while enjoying the gorgeous setting.  That is where any mention of a pleasurable experience ends.  Once seated the service was dismal at best.  Server took 15 mins to bring one glass of champagne even though we saw it sitting in the bar ready to be picked up for over 12 mins (the other members of my party were never even offered a refreshed cocktail the entirety of our stay).  Took another 15 mins for us to track down a different waiter so he could go find OUR waiter so we could order.  Appetizers came fairly quickly and were just ok, very disproportionate servings and not at all worth the prices.  After our apps came, another 30 mins passed before we finally flagged down the manager to find out 1) where our waiter was, and 2) where the rest of our meal was.  10 mins later the manager came back to tell us that the delay was due to our chicken.  2 people in my party ordered the chicken - didn't realize they had to kill the chicken and prep it before cooking because I have never had to wait over 45 mins for chicken (15 mins while we ate our apps and another 30 mins eating our 2nd basket of bread).  Our waiter finally showed up acting completely aloof wondering why we were upset and then quickly disappeared again.  Another 20 mins and still NO FOOD.  We had had enough.  We flagged down the manager to advise we'd be leaving.  He tried to get us to stay and offered to pay for our meals.  At that point he could have offered us meals for the next month for free and we would not have bitten.  This was beyond horrible and honestly the one star I gave it was very generous.  There is nothing anyone could do to ever make me return to this establishment with the staff they have working there.  For what was supposed to be high end resort dining, this was anything but.  I've gotten much better service at Chili's Bar and Grill, and that is just pathetic.  The management and owners of Prado should be ashamed!", "type": "review", "business_id": "RLjA7TBXJfyqDfPuVCcrtQ"}

The kisra and hummus are ok, but kind of a yawn.   The standout appetizer here is the chicken phyllo pakcet stuffed with a delicious mixture of chicken, feta, bell pepper and spinach baked in a flaky puff pastry.\n\nThe pomegranate chicken is tasty, but my favorite dish here by far is the inventive strawberry blueberry cashew salad -it's just a terrific explosion of different flavors.  \n\nFez has an incredibly extensive martini list!

A first glance the place is impressive. It's quaint with a cowboy, southwestern style interior. When arriving everyone was nice and pleasant. It kinda of goes downhill from there.\n\nMy husband asked if he could have chips and salsa. Waitress informs us they only have guacamole, it comes with chips and a salsa trio. Husband didn't want guacamole..only chips and salsa. She brings chips and salsa, but still charges us $9..same price as the guac with the chips and salsa.\n\nI ordered the Wild Salmon. If I could base this review on just the sides it would have gotten 5 stars. The poblano creamed corn was amazing but there wasn't enough of it, maybe a tablespoon, 2 at best. The roasted yukon gold potatoes were roasted perfectly, the only thing they were missing was salt. Easy fix though, right? The salmon was a nice thick piece of fish ever so slightly overcooked, it was supposed to have a red chile glaze, but the glaze had a very floral taste that just didn't work with the fish, at least not for me. \n\nThe husband had the Enchiladas Suiza, with carne instead of chicken. They looked good, he said they were ok. Wished he could have that meat in a Filibertos burrito..would be heaven. His words not mine.\n\nThe child had kid's mac & cheese. Was an order of oily penne pasta with a sprinkle of some sort of cheese on top..he didn't eat it. \n\nWhen our bill arrived we asked if it could be split. Gratuity was already added to the total, thats ok there were several of us,but my problem is when she split the ticket 3 ways she added gratuity again..double the tip...I don't think so.\n\nThe poblano creamed corn was the highlight of my meal and I would have been a happy camper with a large bowl of it, but the $80 price tag for enchiladas, salmon, chips & salsa, oily penne and 3 non-alcoholic drinks, plus the tax & tip was a little too much for our liking.\n\nNot sure if we will return to Sierra Bonita.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DDnmNTvIIQu2t3WZ2EQx-w"}

Finally checked it out on a First Friday, of all nights, even though I regularly stop at Roosevelt right next door. \nThe clothes are incredibly cute but just too expensive for me to justify buying. Not like Urban Outfitters expensive and cute though - at least this stuff is unique and good quality, so if I had an extra $90 lying around, I would totally buy myself a sweater or shirt or that darling pea green corduroy a-line skirt with the swallow patch. I love the dresses, but a hundy on a dress will have to wait til I get a raise (boo salary freeze/recession). However, the jackets were incredibly reasonably priced, around $100-150 and again, very cut. Men's clothes - not totally my taste, a lot of JT style hats and button down shirts ala martini ranch \"I'm dressed up!\"\nBut, I can afford the jewelry, and oh it is cute, cute, cute. Picked up a five-piece, simple silver toned ring for $6 - yeah, you heard me, $6 - and I get compliments on it all the time. Also picked up a nice little silver feather necklace for the sister for xmas and she loved it. The sis had seen one at U.O. or something for like $29, but I got her the one every girl at HH *won't* have for $18. AND, i can say about the men's selection is that I LOVE the hand-screen-printed (can you hand screen print? Does that makes sense) ties ($30)! In bright jewel tones like peacock blue, hot pink and lime green, with awesome prints like an octopus ... or a bicycle. Bought one for the BF for xmas and gave it to him early so he could wear it at his friend's xmas party and it was a hit!

I am not really a fan of most of their food but do enjoy their oysters and their beer.  The service is relatively quick, prices reasonable, and staff fast and friendly as long as it isn't too busy.\n\nHowever, this review isn't just about sitting outside drinking beers with a few friends.  This is about a very unique experience I had recently.  Until recently I had no idea this place even had an upstairs.  It turns out there are a few small rooms upstairs where patrons can dine.  So, I reserved tables for 10-12ish people that were to join my fiance and I for dinner/drinks for her birthday.  I called a few days prior and they were very friendly and said it wouldn't be a problem.\n\nUpon arrival the night of we were taken behind the bar where a \"secret\" staircase could be found that leads upstairs.  I have been here many times and had NO idea about those steps or where they led.  Anyway, up the stairs, are 2 what used to be bedrooms converted into dining areas.  Each room had several small tables.  They reserved one of the rooms for my party which was perfect.  They put all the small tables together in the middle of the room and it was more than enough room for everybody.  Our waitress and servers were quick, friendly, and had plenty of stories about the \"haunted\" 2nd floor.  The food was ok and I should have just stuck with oysters and shrimp but oh well.  I guess its all about the same after a few drinks.\n\nWe were upstairs at our table for about 2 hours and they didn't try to rush us out which was good on this busy Friday night.  I could have sat up there longer to avoid the hassle of going downstairs and fighting to get a drink and a table, but my party grew restless.

Two dinners for less than $10 - awesome! \n\nEven better than that? The service.

It is a little on the pricy side but no more than you would pay at Chipolte or Firehouse Subs. The customer service is great and I have never had a bad experience here.

It was very hard (think thin patio paver).  Although it was drenched in olive oil, I broke the corner of my lower left tooth completely off (I think I must have swallowed it) when biting into it.  Since I didn't realize it until about an hour after leaving the restaurant,  they would not refund the meal or offer to pay my resulting dental bill.  They have a very limited and uncooperative refund policy when it comes to having issues with their food.  I think the only way they would have refunded the meal was if I were accompanied by a camera team who filmed the entire meal and the broken tooth incident, as well as a forensic team who could analyze the contents of my stomach/bowels for the tooth chip, and a cement engineer to test the hardness of their bread/toast versus that of my tooth, which doesn't seem cost effective...  At least I got my calcium when I swallowed my own tooth chip -- I literally got \"my calcium\"!\n\nIf you have any old, stale bread that you are considering throwing out, or that has sat in the sun for a few days after accidentally being left on your back patio table following a meal outside, by all means send it to Chakra 4 so they can then TOAST it, then drizzle a little EVOO on it and serve it to their customers -- RECYCLE PEOPLE!

I even went there for prom night, many years ago. I've been to both of the old locations, and more recently to the new one, and I've tried a good deal of their menu.\n\nI find that the quality of their food is usually pretty damn spot-on. I've been disappointed with my food only once or twice; my normal favorites like the Chicken Picatta are absolutely fantastic and topped with a great mix of tomatoes and capers and such, and perfectly cooked and breaded. The Italian Sausage is fantastic, and the stuffed shells are great too, but the alfredo is usually a bit... tacky. The sauce is a bit thick in that it's usually lopped on top and doesn't mix well, though it's pretty tasty even after that.\n\nThere's enough special about this place to keep you coming back and enjoying yourself. Instead of the industrial strength, flavorless slabs of breaded sad-chicken I've found at other nearby Italian places, the overall quality is really enjoyable for \"mid-range\" Italian food. \n\nThe prices are fantastic: $16 or so for a \"Tour of RigaTony's\" that includes the picatta, sausage, shells, and alfredo is spot on, and easily two meals. The bread is incredible (ask for some scampi butter instead of the oil for a fun treat) and the salad and house dressing are REALLY good. \n\nThe service is hit-or-miss. I haven't been to the new location during any sort of dinner rush, just once a bit later where our server was just fine, but I've been disappointed by the service (especially at the old Brown location) so many times that I've taken to just taking out. RigaTony's travels well, and their carry-out deals include the salad, bread, and usually a dessert, including their tasty chocolate cake.\n\nNot much of an oenophile or drinker in general, so I can't comment on the wine selection at all, but overall, you can have a tasty experience here with generally high quality food all around. Little improvements could make things a lot better, and I'll have to report back the next time I visit during dinner on the service, but I've been going for years and I love the place.\n\n(Oh, one final thing: their lunch specials are INSANE. They vary from day to day, but you can be in and out in about a half hour for $7 with some GREAT food!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "RQWliUrWic_b5FZEj3JThQ"}

I'm pleasantly surprised with each visit to see the constantly changing offerings. \n\nTheir happy hour menu features five dollar flatbreads that are absolutely scrumptious.

But this gravy is different. \nThey call it gravy, but it's an onion based demi glace with a slight hint of deli mustard which if you can believe, accents the corned beef into a culinary triumph.\n\nOne IPA, and a plate of corned beef for lunch and I found myself flat on the couch an hour later, sleeping Sunday afternoon away like a newborn, as Sundays are meant to be.\n\nDuring the week, the Chymist is a fun retreat from work, with its all ages crowd, cigar-friendly patio, and extremely fair happy hour prices.\nThe Chymist is a great place to unwind, or, have a fine meal that in no way resembles typical bar food. \n \nI should probably mention how I've yet to find an unfriendly server or slow service. \nThat's not to say the service is somewhat slower when packed, but if you're there to pound brews instead of enjoying the moment, you'll likely disagree with this review.\n\nOverall, nice job SC management.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Vtx0VYkybAd71fzwgaoQ8g"}

The 7 or 8 other dishes we had were all various degrees of tasty, though the shrimp and soup dumplings stole the show.\nI was there on a busy Friday night and got great service - in fact the server enthusiastically answered all my \"first timer\" questions about the menu, their clientele demographics, etc.  She even gave us a complementary shot of lychee shochu (YUM).

Well I believe it here.  Prices are fair though be warned that if start out hungry and like Asian fusion, you could be ordering more food than any one person should be allowed to eat, and shelling out a pretty penny.  I admit my bill was more than I expected, until I reviewed how much I ate!  I cannot believe I was able to heave myself out of the chair.

Once I did, which was several years ago, I've never taken my vehicle anywhere else for the services they offer. The big thing in my experience with Community Tire and Auto has been a sense of honesty and integrity...which are not qualities always associated with auto repair and maintenance shops. In looking back, I realized that there were at least 2-3 instances with my prior provider of choice (Sun Devil Auto) where I felt pressured to make repairs or conduct maintenance that was questionable, and I should have gotten a second opinion. Altogether, the cost for those visits ran into the thousands of dollars.  I have never felt that with Community Tire. The pricing is fair. They refer to manufacturer's guidelines for all maintenance recommendations. And they occasionally have coupons which are always nice, including a free oil change with your birthday. I almost feel like Community Tire and Auto's service is a secret that needs to be shared so others can experience the peace of mind I have since discovering them myself.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ns64otnQ-WzkjsVS2vVK6g"}

The live music from inside was actually great (not too loud, not intrusive, recognizable songs sung well - what I want from live music in a restaurant!). Even though we sat outside, the inside looked VERY inviting ... we'll see how cold it is (main reason I sit outside is that inside, restaurants are too cold in summer). \n\nThe lobster queso appetizer was great (but too filling).

So I decided to try it another day since I didn't want to stand in line for 30 minutes. It took about 10-15 minutes in line when I tried this place for lunch on Saturday. So bring a book if you want to eat at Joe's.\n\nTHE FOOD\n\nI had the sliced brisket with beans and coleslaw. This is known as the 1/2 pound meat plate that includes two sides. My wife had the chicken. They just dribble a little bit a BBQ sauce onto your meat so you have to make a separate trip to their BBQ Sauce station to get more sauce. I thought the brisket tasted ok, I have had better. The BBQ sauce wasn't anything spectacular. And the beans were just ok for me, kind of like a three bean salad cooked in a sauce. The coleslaw definitely failed. \n\nTHE BEVERAGE\n\nI had the run of the mill refillable soda from the machine. The problem with the refill is that you have to excuse yourself through a line of people to get to the machine. There were actually people waiting in the food line to refill their drinks. That's why I'm glad I sent my wife out on that refill mission. I can imagine the pissed off people that were thinking that you're cutting in line. So the logistics with the soda machine is a complete fail.\n\nCROWD CONTROL\n\nI would hate to be eating in a booth next to the line. Kind of awkward to get out of the booth to get more bbq sauce or a refill and then you have people steering (get it, steer instead of stare) at you as if you were in a fishbowl. Something needs to be done with the table configuration.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn my opinion the brisket is probably the best that I have tasted in Arizona (How I miss Smoque) but the lack of ambiance kills it for me. I would suggest you just order take out and not dine in.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5VMajxduxfLPSyQkVFKESg"}

I think it has pastrami on it and some other stuff, details have faded from memory, but it was really good and I was so sad when they took it away.

Thomas (the GM for those who don't know him) is a combination of dear friend and goofy brother (younger, I guess, but I'd never say that to him).

I still think the concept is great, however thought in the execution seems to have been absent.\n\nWe showed up at 9:20pm for a 9:45pm show. We waited outside the ropes for about 10 minutes until we'd be allowed into our theater. This gave a a few minutes to look around. The theater is linked to both the Salt Lounge and Tanzy Restaurant with coordinated decor making for a very stunning and appealing sight with a comfy feel. We had just came from dinner at Tanzy's (separate review). We ordered the Gold package and were told our server would take care of everything once inside the theater.\n\nOnce we were allowed to enter everyone entered the same door. It wasn't until we were trapped in the line that we realized there was another door on the other side that would have sped up the wait to get into our seat. Maybe if they were both open that might have streamlined seating.\n\nwe got to our seats, got comfortable (more on that), experimented with the electric recliner and generally got situated. Once our server showed, we ordered. My wife wanted a white wine. The server highly recommended one of their Chardonnays. We learned after tasting that 1) don't take wine recommendations from someone not old enough to drink and 2) iPic doesn't know a quality wine from vinegar. The Chardonnay was easily the worst either one of us had tasted and we didn't finish it. \n\nWe ordered Chocolate covered strawberries and the Oreo Ice cream sandwich. Our server didn't know they were out of the ice cream sandwich and told us when she delivered the strawberries. Probably a good thing since that probably prevented another food abortion. The chocolate covered strawberries were also horrible and unripe. My bet is, they're not made on premises but charge as if they were. After just eating at Tanzy, I wrongly assumed the menu would be similar since I believe they're owned by the same. Menu was not great..at least the dessert menu with it's three options. The other option was a Berries Sabayon which the server tried to push after our two previous dessert failures. \n\nNot long into the movie my wife noticed her 3D glasses were dirty. It took about 30 minutes before we saw our \"server\" again to ask for another pair. The second pair was better but not much. They reuse glasses and the high school kids working there probably aren't too into cleaning them well.\n\nComfort. I was all set for a nice comfortable recliner. Not. There is a metal bar running across the middle of the back of the recliner that will be guaranteed to let you know it's there by the middle of the movie. I spent the second half of the movie trying to avoid the bar to no success. The only way I was able to minimize the bar in the back was with the foot rest down which kind of defeats the point of a recliner. Since your feet won't touch the ground (and I'm 6'1\"), that is an uncomfortable feeling as well.\n\nWhile the concept is fantastic, the designers and operators really ignored the details. If you build it, they will come is not a good business model. They may come.....once. And once it will be. We will not be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3SlKa69UVN8KKYYPtlz1ew"}

For those who are used to the original, Barrio Queen is just as tasty, but has a little more room and better parking.\n\nWhether you go for the three tacos for $10, the Cochinitas Pibil torta sandwich, an enchilada, quesadilla or anything else on the menu, you will likely be happy.\n\nBecause it was my birthday, we also decided to try the desserts. I thought the chocolate cake was delicious and my coworkers liked the churros.\n\nI haven't been there at night, but I hear the margaritas and other drinks are tasty as well.\n\nMy only complaint is that they seemed a little understaffed at lunch. One waitress seemed to be handling the whole place and as nice as she was, she was a little overwhelmed so at times we had to try and flag her down for service.\n\nAll in all though, Barrio Queen is one of my favorite restaurants in Downtown Scottsdale.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bOB11LVavtN9PWTNwR52Tw"}

Hong Kong Asian Diner understands and (dare I say) embraces this concept.  Rather than overwhelming you with sub-standard desserts and rice-filled sushi, HKAD delivers a small buffet of about 8 solid Chinese dishes for a very low price ($5.75).  They also have a \"salad bar\" that is so unbelievably terrible that I assume the chef is trying to be ironic.  [It's lettuce, jell-o cubes, canned fruit, and 2 salad dressings, and it's probably refreshed weekly.]\n\nThe egg drop soup was tasty although over-peppered.  I had two favorite dishes on the buffet:  asian green beans (perfectly cooked with some crunch left in them), and Kung Pao shrimp (which goes quickly after it's refilled.  Stay alert.)  The Mongolian beef and beef & broccoli were tender, although the broccoli was overcooked as usual at buffets.  The two type of sweet, deep-fried chicken bites were both enjoyable.  I preferred the lighter, sweeter sesame chicken.  [BTW: nothing was labeled, so I'm winging it with the names if you haven't noticed.]\n\nOther than that, there were some disappointing noodles and the classic staples of fried rice & egg rolls that I couldn't eat due to their porkiness.\n\nAlthough this doesn't read like a rave review, this place is a steal for $5.75.  It's way better than a comparably-priced trip to Panda Express.  I'll take it over those large buffets that are twice as expensive and four times as large.  The food is fresher and I don't have to wonder questions like, \"Why does this huge Chinese buffet also have pizza and french fries?\"", "type": "review", "business_id": "0g_KFvnPIkA8ywTXPPeRCg"}

James, if I recall correctly.

Upon James' suggestion, did the pork and fish tacos.  Both were superb.  The fish taco had some toppings I have never had but made it spectacular and the pork...there are no words.  With a pineapple salsa, it was amazing.\n\nThey have an extensive drink menu, especially the Tequila, hence the name of the joint. The tequila was priced within reason, especially the higher end Top, Top shelf ones. \n\nThe only reason this place did not get a 5star is the seating arrangements.

We go here so often I have bought gift certificates through restaurants.com that is $25 off a $50 bill of ALCOHOL+FOOD. So using this certificate was no problem the first time we went; the waiter checked with her manager before we even ordered to make sure it was alcohol+food. Both said it was valid. So I bring in another certificate a month later, and it's a whole new story when the bill comes. This waitress tells us we are not allowed to use it for our drinks, only food. Contradicting themselves from the month previous we used it. Then the manager comes over and I explain to her the situation and they honored our certificate the month before no questions asked, but she insisted in arguing with me for about ten minutes asking who the manager was, whats their name and waitress' name who \"approved\" this the last time.  After fighting with the he-she, she said she will honor it this time but not the next time with a bad attitude and stormed off. \n\nI have worked years in the food industry and you NEVER argue for any amount of time with the customer. ESPECIALLY if you honored the certificate then change your tune the next visit. I was humiliated in front of our friends we invited out and appalled that the manager had the balls to argue with me for ten minutes.

Around a dozen sandwiches or so. The girl that took my order on the phone was rude and didn't seem to know the menu and how substitutions and add-ons work. I went over the order with her at least 3 or 4 times, every time she missed something as I read it back to her. That should have been the first omen I picked up on to steer clear of this place. \n\nSo, the girl tells me it'll be ready in about 30 min. I work close by, so I give it 15 min and then head over. I have never been to this place, so I thought I would pop in and check the place out while they finished up my order. As soon as I set foot inside the place, I noticed it was empty. Not a single patron during lunch time. Another bad omen in my book. I see a girl at the register, so I walk over to her. She barely mustered a \"Can I help you?\" but did not manage a \"Hello\" in any way shape or form. When I told her who I was and what my order was, she almost barked at me that I came too early and that it wasn't ready yet. \n\nThe sweaty old guy that was making the food had a real sourpuss of a face and kept giving me the stink-eye as he slathered condiments and layers of meat onto hoagies. You could tell he made the food out of spite. Mmmm, sandwiches made with hate. Is there anything sweeter?\n\nAll in all, it took 45 min to make my order. 30 of which I spent at the joint, being uncomfortably stared at. After all that time, I just wanted to get out of there. I grabbed my bags when I was called, asked if there were napkins with the order (to which the girl said yes) and got the hell out of dodge. \n\nI got back to work and went through the order. NOTHING was marked and there were NO napkins. I had to open each sandwich to see what it was and hand out crappy paper towels along with them because we got shafted on napkins. Not cool. \n\nMy sandwich was okay. I did a \"build your own.\" Hot pastrami, mayo, yellow mustard, lettuce and tomato. Hard to screw up, right? WRONG. One half of the sandwich had what I ordered, the other half had... Thousand Island Dressing? What the hell? Yeah. it's like the old man started with the Thousand Island, realized he screwed it up, and instead of tossing out that hoagie, decided to stick with it like no one would be the wiser. The half that was made correctly wasn't too bad. The other half I couldn't even eat. I picked at the pastrami a bit and then threw it away in disgust. Most of my coworkers seemed relatively satisfied, but they all ordered pretty basic subs with cold-cuts. However, one of them ordered a Philly Cheese Steak that we all agreed was the most awful looking sandwich ever made. It was soggy, the meat was unrecognizable. It looked like hamburger meat or chopped liver and not the ribeye beef we were expecting. I took a few bites and it tasted even worse than it looked. \n\nThis place is never getting another penny from me. It's a shame too, 'cause some of the pics people posted here of the sandwiches actually look appetizing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6YviEaoGQG3Kd-BbMn5iow"}

This bar had some good positives but some of the negatives really threw me off.\nAs we walk into the bar, you know, it looks great - loud, live, music that the crowd is enjoying. Great. That was nice. We went straight outside and ordered two AMFs and a jack/coke. The two AMFs were COMPLETELY SOUR tasting. The female added two chunks of lemon to each drink and this was not an AMF you would want to drink - I wouldn't mind if I said, please add this lime, but as we were tipping she just put them in there. Probably the worst AMF I have ever had. Ok, I'll manage, you know, since we're pretty drunk already. We chug our drinks because there's absolutely no way you can slow and casual sip a sour drink. Luckily, the bartender we had the pleasure of being tended by on the inside of the first floor was a life saver. He made two great pink p's for me and my girlfriend while her boyfriend had a redbullvodka. All the while this bartender is being very attentive and giving us plenty of water as we ask for it (I am not one for having a hangover!) Seriously, nicest bartender I've experienced in downtown scottsdale. So we made our journey to the second floor which has HORRENDOUS stairs.. Who has stairs like that for drunk people? I admit, the patio looked nice and the cushions were comfortable. They had good dance music on the inside, but the DJ could have been a little more into the crowd. Anyway. We didn't stay long on the second floor but on the way out we did visit the bartender inside and get another cold glass of water. He was a lifesaver!\n\nDo go - if you want to relive the 70s and 80s\nDo not go - if you want to enjoy some drunk mosh pit!", "type": "review", "business_id": "1mhywrdsgdqJM3OGZIpVtA"}

I let him choose the restaurant because I hadn't gotten him a gift and he did take me to the Josh Groban concert and dinner 3 nights before. I was initially disappointed because I am not fish person unless it is shellfish even though we had eaten here before and enjoyed it.  My disappointment went right out the window the moment we were seated.  They had asked when I made the reservations if it were a special occasion and I told them it was our anniversary. There was an anniversary card on the table with fresh rose petals strewn over the cloth. A real class act but it gets even better. \n\nWe both had the Maine lobster and shrimp bisque - very smooth and rich in flavor. \nMy husband had the Chilean Sea Bass which may make me say, I really do like fish other than shellfish. Cooked to perfection, generous portion and mild with a little crunch on the outside. I had the Jumbo white Gulf shrimp with Jonas crab meat which is where my problem came in because my palate does not tolerate pepper heat and generally I will ask even when something looks innocuous on the menu. I have had meals at other places where they decide to finish the dish with red pepper flakes and have ruined my whole meal since it is not mentioned anywhere.  Someone who likes heat would have loved it. When the waiter asked what we thought, I mentioned that I had made a big mistake and did I miss something on the menu. Apparently, it had some kind of chili oil on it.  I was not expecting anything, my bad, but the next thing we knew, the manager came over.  He offered to recook the meal without the oil but I had already eaten 3 shrimp and told him it was my bad, they could just wrap it and my hubby would eat the leftovers. Instead he said he would comp us a round of drinks.  Again, class act. In addition to the entrees, we ordered two small sides to split (plenty). We had spinach sauteed with garlic and Parmesan cheese plus the crab fried rice with scallions and mushrooms.  The rice was out of this world and the leftovers came home with the shrimp.\n\nThey gave us a choice of complimentary dessert to share and we choose the molten lava cake with vanilla ice cream.  I quickly took my half of the ice cream before my husband took it all.  The cake was absolutely decadent, oozing rich chocolate.  It needed the ice cream to cut it so I am glad I took my 1/2 right away.\n\nAgain, all in all great food and excellent customer service.  More places should follow this example.  The impression they left with us made me immediately say, \"I am going to yelp them and give them a 5.\"  Kudos to you Wildfish!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "8t80-omyflkywRfu9LPh6g"}

We arrived around 7:10pm for a 7:30pm reservation and although the place was maybe 1/4 full, we were told we had to wait for a table. We got a drink at the bar and caught up with friends.\n\nFor starters we had the pate while our friends got the salmon rolls. Definitely not made to order as they were brought out moments later. They raved about the rolls. We thought the pate was good. Be sure to put mustard and honey on every bite.\n\nI didn't see it on the menu, but apparently entrees come with a house salad. It was lightly dressed. The rolls you get, though, are incredible. Don't be afraid to ask for more--they are generous with them. \n\nFor entrees I had the orange duck. It was just ok. The duck was cooked well and had good flavor, but the risotto under it was a bit mushy and lacked flavor. I'd pass on that.\n\nHubby had the beef and it was outstanding. Super tender and flavorful. Get more rolls to mop up the sauce. This is definitely the dish they do best.\n\nFor dessert we had the crepes. They were also just ok. Frozen fruits on top, and you couldn't really taste the almond past (we think the menu was supposed to say paste) filling.\n\nI'm glad we checked it out, but it kind of just gets checked off the list. Not outstanding, but not bad, either. Three courses (plus salad) in three hours. We waited a LOOOONG time for entrees. It was brightly lit inside, so I wouldn't go there for romance.

I ended up getting a Joe Thornton item for my future brother in law..\n\nSince my initial experience, each time I've gone to the store (4 times now) I've always left a bit disappointed. The player(s) I was looking for were never there! Every single time! Yes, they still have tons of Shaun Alexanders', Eli Mannings', NBA Legends (minus Majerle),  and Jose Reyes to name a few.\n\nThe cost of the figures are very reasonable and in line for what I've paid at Target, Toys R Us in the past buying other figures. Usually around $9.99-11.99. \n\nBesides the sports figures, there are also other figures or toys available-Kiss, Halo, GI Joe, Smurfs among others.. \n\nThe store has always been clean and aisles free of scattered toy boxes. You may only had to sidestep kids running around instead of kids and boxes.\n\nNext time I hit Jobing.com for a game or concert, I'll swing by the McFarlane store, but I know what I might be looking for is likely not there. \n\nSome McFarlanes are available next door at Just Sports, but more expensive.

Also, I like the way the place is set up; most of it is outdoors/patio, so it makes for a different experience. There's also a lot of games and things to do. We saw a group of guys playing beer pong on one of the tables, and by the women's restroom there's a lobster catching game. We'd spent like 12 bucks on that game and didn't win ourselves a lobster but we got close one time, and it was pretty damn fun.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bfDQai9X59uWK-XgP0t6rA"}

Although I found the smoked salmon reuben a tad on the salty side, I appreciated the fact that it was served on a nice marble rye.\n\nAs for the beer, I found it fresh and quite drinkable. They offer their own house beers as well as guest taps, so I found the selection was ample enough to satisfy my beer wanderlust.

Dr. Munion runs her clinic as a single-vet practice, so it's always the same vet in attendance. She has a somewhat large group of support staff, which has a high turnover rate, unfortunately quite typical for the industry. Overall, Dr. Munion favors a clinical, diagnostic approach in her practice, so tests and prescribed medications are more common than most other vets we have used. She does use a lot of medical terminology that is beyond most pet owners, including us, but she is helpful in explaining things in plain English if we are flummoxed by the Latin. We would describe her demeanor as clinical, which may seem cold to some pet owners, though it didn't bother us. The clinic is bright and clean, with the usual gnawed corners and chipped Formica. Wait-times are a little less than average of the other vets we have used. The reception area seems a little more chaotic than most, especially the reception desk, which is often staffed with new employees. Prices are average for the area, though as mentioned above, she does tend to order more tests and prescribe more medications than other vets. Be sure to ask why she is prescribing each drug and test, and take notes for later reference. We would recommend Dr. Munion if you prefer a clinical approach, and aren't opposed to follow-up tests and pharmaceuticals. She can be especially helpful if your other vet has been unable to diagnose your pet's condition.

Great event.  I was very happy that I got the chance to have b'fast with 2 yelpers I have not seen in a while, Joan G and Meagan G - so nice to see these ladies!     I had the egg-white omelet.  That was fantastically delicious.  A lot of people love their English muffins too and they sell them by the half-dz.\n\nSo, I am finally, after 4 years of shopping here, writing a review of LGO.  \n\nI love coming here.  Everything about this shop screams hipster and I like hipster stuff too.   I love the lunch salads.  Their salads are often creative and delicious with fresh local ingredients.  Just grab a salad from the cooler in front of the main counter.  \n\nI love the pizza.  IN fact, the pizza here is some of the best in the valley to me.  The star of their pizza, to me, is the delicious crust!  the crust of their pizza has an appropriate balance of crisp and chewiness.  I have also enjoyed some of their cookies.  Certainly the last Yelper Cookie recipe in July 2013  was the best cookie I've had from their Bake Shop.\n\nI know they sell wine and a bunch of other stuff.  I always feel like I'm running into stuff on displays for sale in there; but to be honest, I've never paid that stuff any attention.  I don't know what is on those displays in that store.  When I was in there today, I noticed a children's book on one of the shelves and remembered thinking, odd.  But maybe people buy them and read those books whilst they eat lunch. (?).  \n\nThe parking situation at this corner of Campbell and 40th street is typical of most central phoenix eateries - frustrating, limited, best-to-valet - to name a few adjectives.  Which is why I normally get what I want from LGO to go.  They have convenient \"to-go\" parking spaces right in front that are almost always vacant.  I park, run in , grab what I need and come right back out.    \n\nUntil this morning, LGO certainly had a round-up-able-to 5 star rating in my book.. I had to knock them a star for the following TWO  reasons: \n\n#1 this place doesn't lend itself to large groups at all if you come for lunch or breakfast.  No reservations.  Just dispatch your buddies to hold seats with cell phones, napkins and whatever else you can use as place holders.  \n\nRCV Alert:  \n#2 They got rid of or lost the Tammie Coe Cake's  Red Velvet Cupcakes.   I came to know TCC's RVC when I stopped in to have lunch at LGO once and that's where my love of TCC's RVC originated.  When I stopped in some time ago and saw the RVC cupcapes in the display.  I instantly knew something ewas off/wrong.  It didn't look like my beloved TCC RVC cupcake.  I inquired about the cupcake and why it looked different.  I discovered that TCC's was no longer being sold there, a person working at the counter told me LGO's RVC was just as good as TCC's.  Uhm, Houston, we have a problem, that sales person MUST have fallen and bumped her head!  I don't think so.  I've tried the RVC made by LGO's bake shop 3 times to see if it came close, the cake itself is not as good as TCC's.  The cake itself lacks the appropriate flavor.  The taste is off..  The cake is moist enough, and the texture is just right.  but the lack of enough flavor is where they loose the battle.  The cream cheese frosting is perfectly done.  If their cake's taste popped more, they'd be in a position to take on my #1 RVC in PHX.  Certainly a contender in my Top 5 favorite RVC's in Phoenix.  .", "type": "review", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g"}

In fact there are several intense seminars dedicated to adult training, focusing on developing both the mind and body to properly defend itself. \n\nBasic class setup: Starts of with stretching, cardio, basically a quick warmup. Next a quick meditation (the dojo is a stress free environment, meditation is to help calm your mind). Then you go through basic form drills (to ensure you have correct footing, hand placement, and momentum). Towards the end, there might be sparing drills (safety first, all students are required to wear padding for arms, legs, and a mouth guard). Class is finished off with another meditation to unwind the body. \n\nThe main focus of the dojo is teaching Wado, but there are other floors dedicated for Jujitsu and other Martial Arts Programs. \n\nGreat, clean facility. Near the Ice Den, so plenty of parking. Located in a safe area. Quality wooden floors in the smaller rooms, and padding on the main floor to ensure maximum safety. Clean, cold water fountain. Air conditioned, fans to circulate air. Well lit. Spacious locker rooms, clean bathrooms. Well stocked inventory with padding and gis (uniforms) for all sizes. \n\nNo contracts, just a monthly payment, if you dedicate yourself to the classes and really want to learn, then it is well worth the money!", "type": "review", "business_id": "0GaDryqh_sf7cwl1TPMMIw"}

The server was warm,  friendly and polite and had some great suggestions for dinner and was very patient and waited for us to have  few rounds before we ordered dinner.  The place is pretty big and it seems that if you would come and sit in a different place each time it would be like going to a different place.  Music was jamming something for everyone. Folks were friendly and the place was packed.   \n\nNow, cleanliness it  seems like it could use a wipe down, moping an a power wash in a few spots but I guess after a few cold ones you don't see it anymore.  Will I go back?  Yes, I would, affordable food, good music and  folks all in a good mood I'm there.\n\n4 stars due to they are still a littler ruff around the edges.\n\nPeace :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "2ceeU8e3nZjaPfGmLwh4kg"}

I love the open atmosphere it creates with long large tables, large chairs and open windows and doors to the patio area. The chandeliers hanging in the main dining area add just that bit of \"fancy\" the place needs, perfect touch. I really enjoy the patio seating this time of year, even though you are sat close together to other groups for some reason you still get a privacy vibe. I don't know if it's the way the tables are set up, or the company I was with! They have a small stage inside that they have live music played some nights, but I don't really enjoy it for I feel its a little too much for the restaurant.\n\nThe food is delicious! We decided to get the onion dip and chips for an appetizer, something really easy that you can eat at home right? Well Culinary makes a great dip! We couldn't stop ourselves, trying to remember that our main courses were coming! I had the rainbow trout! I NEVER eat fish so when I am randomly craving it, this place is where I come. It's smothered in almonds and this delicious creamy sauce...... HANDS OFF I don't share this dish. My boyfriend decided to ordered the fried chicken (which you have to wait a little extra time for) and it was definitely worth the wait. The chicken was moist and tender and the sides of mashed potatoes and coleslaw were like eating at grandma's house.\n\nI am very impressed with the staff here. On a Wednesday night, it was pretty packed, for 2 we had to wait about 30 minutes but the staff is very courteous by grabbing your cell number and texting you when your table is ready. The bar had a few open seats, so we were able to have a drink before dinner. I like that there are no uniforms here, each of the staff members are able to show off their individuality and personality with the way they dress, which I feel makes them more comfortable and friendly. Its really hipster, the staff is very friendly and laid back! If you're not paying attention it does make it a little hard to find your waitress or waiter, but you should be so kind to pay attention to the people taking care of you for the evening.\n\nCertainly a great place to put on your list. Great location, great atmosphere, great staff and delicious food! Keep it up Culinary!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "xY1sPHTA2RGVFlh5tZhs9g"}

Awesome bang for your buck at about $8 for an 8-inch pie and friendly service.\n\nThe long: During downtown's First Friday Art Walk, we often snag dinner at the food trucks, usually opting for some delicious gourmet hot dogs. This month, Short Leash was absent, but Pizza People's giant dark green truck was in its place. While I was a little skeptical about getting a decent pizza out of a food truck (more specifically, the kind of oven you might be able to pack into a food truck), I need not have worried. While the 12-minute wait might have seemed long for food truck food, and while I'm no expert, the pizza was great and well worth the wait.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Popeye, featuring spinach, basil, garlic, tomatoes, and green onions. Luckily, they just happened to already have a Popeye, baked and boxed, and were willing to sell it to us at a discout if we were willing to buy it and wait for my pizza to bake. Of course we agreed, and we treated it as a first course while we waited for my custom sausage, green chilies, mushroom, and black olives pizza. The pizza was still nice and hot, but not so hot that we had to wait before digging in. \n\nThe toppings were awesome--fresh and ample without overwhelming the pie. The cheese had just the right amounts of give and chew. The spinach was cooked, but not cooked to mush. And the true test of pizza, the crust, was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, thick and structured enough to hold the toppings up without buckling under their weight. We devoured it, right down to and including the bones (the crust/cornicione), which I too often leave on the plate because it's usually just substandard bread. These bones were truly enjoyable. My pizza came out 12 minutes later, as promised. I personally should've laid back a little on toppings, and somehow, a sprinkling of basil chiffonade made it onto the pizza, but it was still good. However, the crust kept flopping, either because we didn't wait long enough for the pizza to cool or because it was just floppy crust. After the Popeye, I want to think it was because we should've waited just a little longer to dig in. I still really enjoyed it, though, and look forward to visiting the truck again--hopefully it will be a frequent vendor at First Fridays, Food Truck Friday, and Saturday at the Downtown Public Market!", "type": "review", "business_id": "N_n2jyCfpon3NzKERYT02Q"}

After deciding to take a chance on The Breadfruit, I am left pleasantly surprised.  We had made reservations prior to dining and I would recommend that to everyone; it is not that big of a restaurant and fills up quickly.  We started out with Plantain/Avocado baked Spring Rolls and some Jerk Prawns.  Both dishes were fantastic.  The jerk seasoning had an appropriate level of spiciness and the baked plantain rolls were creamy and sweet with the mango chutney that comes with it.  For dinner we had the pimiento-smoked mussels and the jerk chicken.  Both dishes were awesome.  You could taste the smoky flavor in the broth of the mussels and the jerk chicken was fantatstic. \n\nFor drinks, we both started out with their dark n stormy rum/ginger beer concoction. Expensive, but worth it.  Also had a couple Red Stripes, which, at $4 each is a bargain.\n\nThe waiter was a little pushy with the suggestions and specials, but, he is partly a salesman, and was doing his job.\n\nI will go back to the Breadfruit, as I am a huge fan of rum, and they have a whole other side of the restaurant dedicated to that fine sugar cane juice.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cLojUtqkFpVIHFEvA_5Atw"}

He said he didn't include the diamond (whatever that means, what the hell did he think I was there for?) and that there is a more complicated process for that, but I could expect a \"little\" increase in value.  A little?? I then pulled out an appraisal for the diamond alone from 1991 stating a value of $2400 and told him to have a terrible day.

Had fairly low expectations as you don't hear much about Verona Chophouse and I've lived in the area for about 20 years.  I am always leery about \"upscale\" casino restaurants as most are really hit and miss - especially those in Vegas with celebrity chefs' names attached to them.  \n\nOur first trip was well beyond our expectations, starting with a salad that appeared to be plucked from someone's garden to the perfectly cooked and seasoned filet.  The service was perfect, but a little odd in a good way.  We expected a refined and polished server with a side of arrogance, typical for a joint like this and what we got was a \"motherly\" type woman who was not only attentive and knowledgeable but also caring and went out of her way to make us comfortable with a bit of a dry sense of humor.  What a nice change of pace! \n\nSecond trip demonstrated that the first wasn't a fluke.  I opted for the Veal Chop and my wife the Filet.  This time the Filet was unimpressive and a little smallish and perhaps overdone, but the Veal Chop was outstanding.  It was huge and so well-prepared that I had a hard time feeling sorry for my wife's sub-standard cut of beef.  Thankfully it was big enough for us to share and we both left satisfied.  The service was again fantastic and we were taken care of by another woman who valued delivering real service and comfort over playing the stereotypical server role.  This trip we noticed the doors to the beautiful outdoor patio were open and a band of some sort was getting ready to play.  \n\nSidenote: We originally chose the Chophouse because Shula's at another casino just a few miles away was booked.  It is really hard for us to find value in Shula's after dining at Verona Chophouse.  Sure Shula's can be great, but by my estimation, you will pay about 30-40% more there and you could still get an average meal and crappy service  AND there is no way in hell Shula's could make a Veal Chop as good as Verona.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5cIen1hlpeO_M1jVKBQR-g"}

The bar was offering $3 domestic beers and $2 pirate rum drinks. I started with a pirate rum & coke. The bartender made a very good drink and the shirt allowed me to get up to the front of the line. The club started filling up, mostly in the back; up front was sparse and the front patio was empty. After 3 rum & cokes and a beer I decided it wouldn't be much of a crawl if I stayed in one spot. Plus the Tavern specials were all night long, where other places had specific hours.

My husband could eat mexican food seven days a week, so we decided to give it a try.  They opened at the beginning of November, so they still have Alex Padilla as their Executive Chef.  We were so happy we had the opportunity to meet him and talk to him for a few minutes.  \n\nThis place has been completely remodeled, I didn't even realize until a few minutes later that this is where Roy's used to be.  I loved the decor, simple, classy.  The decorative doors are really cool.  We started with a couple of margaritas.  My husband had the Taberna and I had the classic.  They were both excellent.  I was not very hungry so I decided to have the Jicama salad.  It was not only beautiful but also delicious and refreshing.  Loved the texture combination.  My husband had the tortilla soup, and the beef tacos.  I am not a soup person, but I found myself going back to my husbands soup 4 or 5 times more.  Every bite was a little different, one time some corn another the melted cheese at the bottom.  The presentation is really beautiful, a miniature cast iron pot, with the lid to the side, very clever.  The soup is not the broth base type, maybe that is why I liked it.  I only eat chicken soup when I am sick.  This is more of a tomato base and creamier.  The beef tacos are made with filet mignon, I took a bite and it was delicious.  \n\nI thought I was going to be good today, but then we had a couple of desserts in front of us.  I couldn't resist, I loooooove Tres Leches cake, so when I saw it in front of me, I was in love.  It was perfect, the texture, the milky/condensed milk oozing from the soft, spongy cake.  I had more than what I should have.  I will have to go on the treadmill a couple of extra hours this week.  I also had the flan, this is the Mexico City style with cream cheese, which makes it a little denser.  It was truly delicious, but I am still partial to Tres Leches, I think this might be the best one I have had in the past six years.  I'll post some pictures of the dishes we had soon,  they were too pretty not to picture them.\n\nI am so happy this place is in Scottsdale,  I love Phoenix and its cuisine, however I have too many friends who are not adventurous enough to stray away from their area.  I will definitely come back sometime soon and enjoy a drink by the fireplace.  Really cool place!", "type": "review", "business_id": "xz1fQwwVAhqA9MsmMaGyZA"}

Previous to my first actual drinking experience at the Roosevelt, I had been there during First Fridays. Bad decision. It's a small craftsman converted house so couple it with its popularity, the masses and its location smack dab by the Roosevelt street fair this place was packed. \n\nI love that you walk in through the door into a room where you see a small bar with 4 stools, in the first room there's a table for two, and a sofa chair. The back room has a long table for 6. and the side rooms have three table that can see 2 to 3 ppl each, and the other street facing room can fit 2 groups of maybe 4 at most each. So you can imagine of FF it's a little claustrophobic. Anywho, I made a mental note to come back. So I went on a Thursday evening and that evening I was craving a grilled cheese and I heard about the most amazing things about the grilled cheese with tomato soup, so I ordered it with a true pint of belgian witte. OMFG... that grilled cheese was YUM! and a deep bowl of steaming tomato soup! with a real cold true pint of belgian witte that mind you when even with a third left the glass and beer was still cold. AMAZING! not sure how they do that but 4 peaks take note por favor! The server had a wine deal where she's said if you ordered a wine bottle and consumed more than 2 glasses that they would charge the bottle for 50% less. fun stuff. I just have to say it was kinda dark but it would make a great place to bring a special someone and enjoy each other's company. Friends work too =P Overall loved the Roosevelt and will return... Oh and let's say their menu had both sides filled with all the beers they offered...

Each time is as great as the previous.\n\nMy most recent visit was during the peak of the Holiday 2013 season, and seven of us showed up on a Friday night (after having called ahead to several other restaurants and being told that the wait time was 90+ minutes). Upon our arrival, we discovered that the restaurant was packed as usual, but even though we didn't have a reservation they could seat us on their outdoor patio in 5-10 minutes. Initially, we were hesitant to sit on the patio in mid-December, but it ended up being very pleasantly warm since the space was enclosed and had outdoor heaters.\n\nIn my many visits to Beckett's Table, I early on inadvertently complimented the owner on their service and delicious chocolate truffle dessert (no longer offered). From that moment, every time since I came in and she saw me, she would magically procure the truffles from the kitchen, even though they were longer listed on the menu. This time, we warmly greeted each other and exchanged holiday pleasantries. But alas, they no longer kept the truffles, even as special treats. I mentioned that our group of seven was a reunion, of sorts, and that our little group included a New York foodie. Well, after consuming a delicious appetizer/entr\u00e9e meal (of which the foodie raved), the wait staff brought us a sample of all the desserts (in a trough, no less), compliments of the owner. We were stunned and grateful (maybe ordering a lot of wine and padding our bill had something to do with it). \n\nSo once again, my experience at Beckett's Table proved to be a wonderful culinary experience, with the personal attention from the owner that adds that specialness to each dining experience there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "I4bSn5gXsHuSPu7L-d_8nQ"}

While only one couple was in the restaurant when I arrived, the wait for my takeout order was nearly 30 minutes. \n\nMy order was for the (1/2) Ground Beef Taco and the Lamb and Potatoes. While I announced, then clarified my order ... THEN watched the order taker clarify it for the cook, my order was still wrong. I didn't want to wait any longer, so I never said a word about it because I needed to leave. What I actually received was the Navajo Taco which includes whole pinto beans instead of ground beef. The shell tasted fine, but fell apart the moment I picked it up from the carryout container. The filling/topping ingredients were fine ... after I picked off the pinto beans which were about half the volume of the toppings. My friend tells me the Lamb and Potatoes was a bit bland and could have used flavor from hot sauce or, at least, salt and pepper. \n\nAn odd occurrence while I waited for the food to be prepared was the order taker offered to put lemonade in a restaurant-use-only glass, instead of a carry out cup. Basically, he wanted me to drink all the lemonade while I waited, instead of carry it out. Of course, I firmly, but politely, declined. He then went to the stock area to find the carryout cups. Was this all about avoiding the walk over to the stock area?!?! Why would I consume any beverages there only to carry the food away? \n\nLet's just say Sacred Hogan has plenty of room for improvement. They MUST concentrate on correct order placement, speed of service, cleanliness (I never saw so much as a plastic glove), decor (only 3 wood Navajo carvings being blocked by other stuff exist) and ... oh, how about flavor?!?!

When we go with a group, we always ask for extra dipping sauce so it is enough to share among everyone. One basket is enough to share among three-four people.\n\nFEZ kisra is very flavorful. Lots of fresh and flavorful topping, one of my hubby's favorite on the menu. \n\nFEZ burger is a good one when you want a safe option to try out their food, if you are a little less adventurous. The field salad that comes with it is fresh and tasty too. \n\nMy favorite dish is the Crisp Pomegranate Chicken. The sweet flavor of pomegranate dressing and the tender chicken breasts are beautifully complimented by the veggie and fruits that are placed below the chicken. \n\nA surprise item was the breakfast kisra. It was actually surprisingly good, even my father in-law did not mind it. He has always been a simple cheeseburger kind of guy, but has really enjoyed all the food he had tried here.\n\nWe yet to try their desserts, mainly because by the time we are done with the fries and the main course, there was no more room... seriously, their portion is well worth the money!\n\nThe only one thing I did not really care for was the FEZ lettuce wraps. \nIt was cold and a little too sweet and fruity for me. But again, I don't really like overly sweet food...\n\nI don't drink alcohol, but a few times my hubby and friends tried a few of their signature drinks and really really loved them. The list of a few favs: honeydew melon, key lime pie, apricosmo and pomtini. I did enjoy the virgin mojito here, FEZ is one of the few places I can actually order that.\n\nSeriously, take yourself out there now and give it a try. Treat yourself with a basket of cinnamon and sugar dusted sweet potato FEZ fries, and try out one of their dishes, your taste buds will thank you for it.\n\nAlso, I rate their services to be outstanding compared to most of the restaurants at this price range.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EWMwV5V9BxNs_U6nNVMeqw"}

Let me just say, it was like we dined at a totally difference restaurant!  We were pleasantly greeted by the hostess, who offered us our choice of table (despite the fact that the place was just about at capacity).   To start us off, our server recommended a new specialty cocktail with vodka, fruit juice and Prosseco which was less than 99 calories.   It was delicious! She also recommended a couple Pino Noir options for Hottie, who was very pleased.  I started off with the Flemings salad.  Really nothing special, actually the dressing was rather bland and it was served over romaine.  It really should have been served over spring mix or arugula... and adding a little cheese never hurts!  Regardless, I was perfectly happy with the complimentary warm bread and infused butter spreads to start me off.  For dinner the server recommended a \"super secret\" menu item for vegetarians.    I'm not sure what it was called, but it had layers of spinach, portabella, asparagus and roasted red pepper served over a very tasty red cream sauce .  On the side, I ordered the chipotle mac-n-cheese, YUM!  I don't even want to imagine the number of calories that were stuffed into that plate of cheesy goodness!  My Hottie ordered their special, a filet bone-in cooked medium rare with Flemings potatoes on the side.  This time his steak came out cooked perfectly, in fact by the end he was eating it off the bone... gross! For desert we had the chocolate lava cake.  I was a little leery, because typically these are served very small and obviously just reheated in the microwave for about 30 seconds. Not the case here.   It was the size of a softball, and just heavenly... warm chocolate oozing out of center, topped with ice cream and some kind of pistachio cookie... mmmm, still licking my lips! Okay, Flemings... Now I'm a FAN!", "type": "review", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ"}

So while I recognize I've got a little 'local bias' in me, I have no problem noting things I don't love.\n\nLiberty Market is a just a great joint.  It really deserves credit for planting the first flag in the name of the blossoming downtown Gilbert foodie movement.  \n\nMy kids used to tell me they liked going to Liberty because their bathrooms were awesome.  They're right of course, but the food is pretty good too.  :)\n\nTo the coffee...   Like many others I am sure, I can rate my liveliness (if not likeability) each day on a scale of  'BC / AC' - Before Coffee / After Coffee.  Liberty definitely has the best coffee bar in the area - and their stock brew is Portland's Stumptown!  You can't go wrong with any of the coffee bar choices, but the Ca Phe (Vietnamese) and Cortadito / Cortado (Cuban micro) are favorites, as is the simple French Press.  \n\nLiberty always has a super assortment of pastries to choose from, should thy tooth be feeling sweeter than thy coffee.  They do a great job of keeping some favorites while always adding new treats to try.  I don't have a big sweet tooth, but I've enjoyed the innovative griddled bread pudding and like their bisuity scones - especially vanilla with coffee.  My kids go bonkers for the Salt River Bars.  \n\nThe pizza is on par overall with Grimaldi's, which the only pizza@chain I really love.  I'd rate them pretty equally because Liberty has more specialty choices.  To me, the crust at Liberty (and Grimaldi's) is spot-on perfect and they use fresh mozzarella to boot.  The perfect pizza crust should be chewy, with a crunchy, crusty tooth.  Also, you shouldn't have to wait 5-10 mintues for an inch thick of liquid hot magma cheese to cool before you dig in and then later wonder whether you'll be able to digest it - which is a problem with typical pizza place pizza.  A real pizza is spectacular right out of the fiery, burning furnace and thrown on your table.  That first 5-10 (10 is pushing it) is the window when a pizza is more than just a 'pizza.'   It becomes more and more mundane after 5 minutes.  \n\nDon't Yelp-punch me if you're from the Midwest and are screaming about Lou Malnati's or the like.  That is a savory pie.  It can be very delicious.  But it isn't pizza.  \n\nHey, I didn't make the Rules della Pizza.  \n\nNaples did.\n\nThe sandwiches at Liberty are very good.  My favorites are the Farmer Press and the Turkey Brie.  However, the cold-case sides feel 'hit or miss' in my opinion (since Liberty has high standards).  My advice is to find one you like and keep going back to that well.  The burgers are outstanding, although I only eat a couple a year.  Liberty always has some really creative specialty burgers that are worth checking out if you are a carnivore.\n\nThe fish dinners, especially the specials, are worth their price.  Gourmet restaurant quality with great sides (I can never get enough cauliflower mash) and special sauces.\n\nI used to have some gripes about Liberty breakfast - not that it was bad, just that you had few alternatives to biscuits and greasy potatoes.  I think the Liberty Potatoes have way too much cheese, but I'm sure some may disagree.  It used to bug me you could not get eggs made to order - but they appear to have changed that policy.  In fact, I had over-easy eggs (opposed to sunnies) yesterday.....\n\n....which brings me to ending this review with my favorite item on the current menu - the chilaquiles.  They are absolutely fantastic.  Salsa pequin, one of the salsas they pour over the dish, is one of my favorite Mexican salsas (tomatoes and tomatillos both, for a tangy and earthy spice).  Liberty does the chilaquiles as well as they can be done, period.  \n\nThe net-net recap - Liberty is a great choice for almost any taste.  It gets a 5 star review from me in part for that - but also for having some items that nobody nearby really does better - coffee, pizza, fish - and now chilaquiles.  :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw"}

I wanted to go out and eat, drink, and be merry so we got reservations at Verona Chophouse for 11:15 on Christmas day.   This was our first visit and overall it really was a good experience.  If I'm being honest, my review is more of a 3.5.  They open at 11:00 and we got there around 11:05.  We were about 5th in line to get in.  One drawback was standing in line next to the Fairy's Mist or Bounty or some shit slot machine while Ol Lady Wild Turkey smokes her Kool 100s and waves them around and cackles about the good deals she got in Laughlin.  Good Lord....\n\nWe were seated right on time.  The selections on the buffet were nice.  Some stand-outs were the prime rib, scalloped potatoes, bacon, and scrambled eggs.  I didn't go near the salad section, but it looked good and fresh from where I stood getting my plate full of bacon and eggs.  For $30 apiece I didn't think it was too bad of a value, but a cheap mimosa thrown in would have been nice.  The only thing that wasn't good on the buffet was the cubed sweet potatoes.  They were only about half cooked and had NO flavor.  A chef-type person kept walking around surveying the scene and I can't believe those sweet potatoes were put out.  Not good at all.  \n\nWe also didn't use the omelet station, but we sat very close to it and it appeared that the young woman cooking was very friendly and fast and the omelets looked good.  I wasn't going to go near the dessert area, but there were a couple of things I just could not resist.  They had mini cannolis and then some small tartlets with what tasted like a peanut butter mousse.  Delicious!  \n\nTheir patio area is so lovely and next time I want to be sure to sit out there if weather permits.  Our server was very attentive and friendly too.  There was one snafu I think with some of the staff trying to light one of those heaters outside or something because suddenly there was some screaming and I wondered if I needed to grab my knife and hit the deck, but it was something to do with the heater I think.  I can see what other reviewers say about the servers.  Most appear to be just fine, but I think they could take the professionalism up a notch.  This is a nice place, and they should treat it as such.  Not that they were bad, but those that have been there probably know what I mean.\n\nWhen we walked in we noticed the wine bar area looked really nice.  I think next time we'll try to snag a table in there.  I am optimistic that when we go back we'll have another good experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5cIen1hlpeO_M1jVKBQR-g"}

It had a great char on the outside and nice and juicy on the inside.  I got the mixed basket of fries and onion rings which is enough for 2.  If you read some of my previous reviews you know I don't like to share fries so you know this was a big size of fries and onion rings.  Another great thing is that it was inexpensive $5 for the cheeseburger, $4 for the hamburger and $4 for the rings and fries.  \n\nIf you watch Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network they would refer to this place as a Dive and I think the people their would not mind.

Yes, it's in Queen Creek and it's quite a trek to get here if you don't live in the area but it's so worth it.  During the Arizona cool weather the olive trees give a nice shady atmosphere in the front grounds.  There is live music on the weekends, wine tasting, little kids running around, and pets sniffing about.  My brother from San Francisco says \"It's like Tuscany...I can't believe this is in AZ\".  \n\nStaff:  I have seen them grow as well.  They had their growing pains early in the days but now, they are like a well oiled machine.  Super helpful, super friendly, and they are there to please.  Even if it gets busy on the weekends, they are also with a smile.  \n\nFood:  I would say it is a few dollars more than the usual places...but this is not a usual sandwich shop either.  The portions are big enough to share.  We love getting the Antipasto Platter with a couple glasses of wine or beers or a bottle of wine to share and sit and enjoy the afternoon.  The sandwiches are awesome.  They get all of their meats from the local Pork Shop across the street.  The veggies and herbs are straight out of their very impressive garden.  They serve breakfast, kids menu, desserts too.  Speaking of desserts...they have a delicious selection of gelato...to die for!  \n\nThey recently started serving Oven Baked Pizzas on the weekend nights and it's really good.  This is Italian Pizza, thin crust!  They have live music too and the atmosphere is really fun.  \n\nThe Olive Mill is a bonafide mill.  They have olive trees and they have olive presses.  They have tours so you can learn about the process of making olive oil.  They have a super awesome store with all sorts of yummy olive goodness....don't miss out on the Cup Cakes made with infused olive oil...they are heavenly.  \n\nThis is our weekend go to brunch place.

On a recent visit into town I came here for happy hour and it was a good time!!! \n\nIf you like sushi & sake happy hours, this is the place for you!!! They have a good selection of half prices appetizers (I'd say about 15 different selections ranging from $3-5 during happy hour) & sushi. Unlike a lot of sushi happy hours, which typically only offer California, tuna, and Philly rolls during happy hour, this place also offers yellow tail, Caterpillar, & rainbow rolls amongst several others (and \"spicy\" versions of a lot of these). The sushi is above average and worth the $3-5 that most rolls cost during happy hour. \n\nEnough about the food though!!! This IS happy hour after all, so it's the alcohol you want to hear about!!!! Well, the group I started off with wanted to sample the infused sake Geisha offers during happy hour, which includes strawberry, apple, pomegranate, and mango. We tried all of them except the strawberry. The apple was a little watered down but the mango and pomegranate were both good. These were $4 each during happy hour for about 4 or 5 sake glasses worth for each.  Next up were sake bombers!!! Three dollar Sapporo's and I think $2 for sake. They also offer specialty cocktails during happy hour, which I didn't try, but apparently they've changed a little from when Geisha first started happy hour. \n\nThe night we were there we had about 10 people in our group. I wish I could remember our waitress's name, but she did a good job handling us. She had no problem dividing up bills, and didn't give the evil eye when a few people complained about drinks. She just switched them out no questions asked. \n\nLike I said, if you like happy hour sushi & sake, you'll like this place!!! Happy hour runs from 4-7. Since I was visiting from out of town and a couple people I came with got off work early we showed up shortly after it started. It was a great way to start the evening, but as you can imagine those of us who started here were a DISASTER by the end of the night!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "gUt-pPUpOVVhaCFC8-E4yQ"}

I wanted to give it a middle of the road 3, but according to Yelp's rating guide a 3 is \"A-OK\" and this place isn't that good.  The schnitzels are all prepared the exact same way except for the different gravies or toppings.  Sur Kate makes its schnitzels by pounding a piece of pork flat. Breeding it and then frying it in oil.  This is basically what a schnitzel is but schnitzels should all flavored be flavored slightly differently (not just in the gravy but the breeding and cooking method as well).  Without the gravies the schnitzels at Sur Kate are plain bland and soulless.  Comparing these to what a real homemade/flavorful German schnitzel should taste like is like comparing a fried hamburger patty to a BBQ marinated filet mignon.  The sides are passable - not great - not bad not even just plain good.  All in all the food is just OK, but then again the food at BK or Wendy's is also OK but a lot cheaper and quicker.\n\nI could put up with less than stellar food if the service was great or good but the service is even more disappointing than the food.  Once you walk through the door there is no real indication as where to wait to be seated.  So you just stand there.  It takes forever for anyone to acknowledge that you are there and then even longer for someone to seat you.  Even then they do not seem that trilled that you are there.  I thought that this was just a onetime observation or that my group was dressed wrong, but as I watched the door for our 1 and a half hour stay I saw that every party through the door was ignored and treated with the same distain.\n\nWell to get the 4s and 5s other people seem to feel is appropriate the wait staff must be out of this world  - wrong.  The wait staff jam as many parties to a table as they can then spend as little time interacting with the guests as possible.  None of the waitresess seemed to know the menu or what made German food German.  I had to flag someone down to get a drink refilled but actually the glass was removed but the refill did not come until I was trying to pay (which required me tracking my waitress down to get the bill. She wasn't busy working but talking.)\nThe decor was down home German and fun. We came in on a Thursday and there was a man and woman strolling through the restaurant singing and playing an accordion. This made the atmosphere wonderbar. The regulars all seemed to know each other and the staff.  They all seemed to be having a wonderful time.  \n\nNow it may not seem like it but I had fun here.  We sang and danced a little.  By sitting with other parties at the same table we met new people.  That part was great.  If a good atmosphere and a fun time are what you seek this is a place to try.  If you want good food and quality service this is not the place for you.", "type": "review", "business_id": "GzWiVvE6JDdBNowNVshItA"}

She was admitted for \"overnight observation\" on a Sunday morning as her vet was not available until Monday.  I was awakened by a 4 am phone call from another vet advising she needed \"emergency\" surgery that would cost $3500.  Why?  He didn't know, but stated since her vomiting was not responding well to medication, it was best to do the exploratory to look for this mysterious foreign body.  I insisted she at least wait a few hours until she could get an ultrasound at the adjacent clinic when they opened.  The ultrasound showed no indication of a foreign body or any other internal problems.\n\nLater that morning, my own vet examined her and made an instant diagnosis of an allergic reaction to her new thyroid medication.   And yes, I had advised the emergency clinic of the medication, the dosage, and the length of time the cat had taken it, when I arrived.  She made a full recovery once back in the care of her regular doctor.  \n\nHad I not trusted my own instincts, I might have been influenced by the \"expert\" recommending this geriatric cat be operated on with no clinical indications. \n\nHowever, don't be concerned about unauthorized medical treatment.

It has the standard toppings, the beans are good, the red sauce that they drape over it is great. But what makes these better then most is first the cheese, love the flavor and their not afraid to pile it on. But what wins me over every time is that they cook the plate in a broiler, which makes it all nice and hot, melts, crisps up the cheese and the chips.

I ordered the bison w/ Goat cheese and other toppings and asked the waiter (Chris, who must be related or something to the owner as his picture is on the website with the owner) if they could grill/sautee the red onions I had selected and he point-blank told me \"no, I can't do that\" - not even a smile or a gesture that he was sorry for the bad news. That kind of peeved me.  I asked nicely and I was already buying a $13 burger, the LEAST he could say was \"you know we don't really do that, but maybe we can have them do it this once\".. or hell, even if he said \"we can't because {enter good excuse here}\"...no, he said \"no, I can't do that\".  If he's related to the owner, you think he'd be schoold in customer service - nope, not the case.\nAlso, when I asked for our check to be split (there were three of us on a work lunch and none of the orders were crazy or split or confusing), he made this face and said \"yeah, fine\".. again, that is not customer service.\n\nIn short, the burger I had was great tasting (and so were my friend's burgers - BBQ and Turkey Burger), but, like I said, this detail of customer service really goes a long way and brought them down from 5 stars to 3 because CUSTOMER SERVICE is KEY!!!  You've seen my other reviews - service is pretty key for me to come back!  \n\nAlso, their sweet potato fries are much better than the zucchini fries..", "type": "review", "business_id": "adKyTJT-RtaTP0krxLyQwQ"}

I stop in about once or twice a month.  The place is small, little tasting room connected to the brewery/warehouse.  They have continued to make the tasting room better - added an actual bar top, put in a few TVS; but it is a very low key place.  Management really supports the local community, so they have local artwork displayed around the tasting room.  It fills the plain walls, but I could see this as being a little overwhelming or tacky.  You come here to try their beer, there is no food but there are food trucks that will park in the parking lot on certain days.  The beers seem to be getting better as the brewery expands their line-up.  I believe they are up to seven beers, they originally had three.  The Ironwood Imperial Porter is legit!  Even if you are not one to drink darker beers, its worth a try.  This is my favorite as the beers are more English style and I prefer hoppy beers and the Phx Ale Camelback IPA doesn't really do it for me.  It is good, just not what I look for in an IPA.  Another plus is that you will order your beers from the owners (usually).

I got mixed reviews and wasn't really sure what to expect. So here goes what I thought:\n\nThere are two trails (for sure, there could be more but I understand these to be the two main trails): Cholla and Echo Canyon. \nCholla is supposed to be easier.\nEcho Canyon is supposed to harder.\nWe originally planned to hike Cholla but after the GPS lead us to the Echo Canyon parking lot and we spotted a parking spot, we pounced (after reading that parking is crazy). I'm not sure how we got so lucky, but we did! Anyways, we realized we were at Echo Canyon and decided we'd try it... even though I thought it would be too challenging, my family persisted. Well, I was wrong.\n\nEcho Canyon is NOT as hard as I expected. \n\nYes, it is all uphill. Yes, you have to \"climb\" in some parts... but no, you are not \"rock climbing\". I expected having to heave myself up a ledge... it is NOT like that. There are two parts with metal railings... they are really just to assist you. You can get up without them, but they are helpful. It doesn't feel like you're going to fall because basically it's all ROCKS. You're climbing on big rocks, so you won't struggle to keep from sliding down. Not like that at all. \nContinuing up the trail, you have to use your hands to help go up, but it's not like you're using a ton of upper body strength. Mostly you're using your hands for balance, and a little extra \"oomph\". The way down is easier, but does kind of hurt your knees (more jumping, but not as much strength). \n\nSo, the hike for us?\n- Took my parents (two adults, late-40's, workout a few times a week) about 2 hours. They thought it was pretty hard, but very fun. They took periodic breaks though and were fine.\n- Took my brother and I (two teenagers) probably 1.5 hrs or so. I workout through sports or the gym almost every day, but I am NO superhuman athlete like I thought you had to be. I was expecting to be struggling and panting and dying climbing Camelback, but it really was NOT that bad. \n- Yes, you do need good athletic shoes. Yes, you do need water. No, I don't think you need gloves or any fancy gear. A snack at the top won't hurt, but I wasn't craving nourishment. \n- Kids are maybe okay doing it. I saw lots of families with younger kids, and they were doing okay. True, the child probably has to be at least 8, or into doing a challenging hike. You can always turn around though. \n\nBut do be careful. Sadly, we saw on the news that an older man died later that day hiking the Echo Canyon trail. Really monitor how you're feeling... it's okay to turn around, it is a tough trail. But if you workout and enjoy physical activity, this hike should be fine.\n\nOverall, LOVED the hike and had tons of fun. Great workout, and just a fun way to get active.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6rijZ1qIjiq1Dgdy35iqxw"}

Bacon chocolate chip cookies, bacon brittle, bacon-infused vodka, and bacon Bloody Mary's? They're all available somewhere in Scottsdale, but you can find the famous Bacon Bloody Mary here at Bacon.\n\nThis is a cool space for a breakfast spot, with indoor-outdoor seating and lots of light. Our server, who seemed to be a bit overworked since he was the only waiter, was very friendly and welcoming. We ended up ordering one of their special bacon eggs Benedict with a Mornay sauce to share, plus a side of fruit, and the main reason we'd come here: the Bacon Bloody Mary.\n\nWhile my sweetie was in the restroom, his Bacon Bloody Mary arrived. It looked great, even though Bloody Mary's are not my thing, with a nice stalk of celery and some pimento-stuffed olives. But something seemed to be missing. Hmm, what could it be? Well, unless the bacon had been blended up along with the other ingredients, it was the BACON that was missing in the BACON Bloody Mary! Bacon FAIL!\n\nWe mentioned this to our server when he brought our food and he was properly dumbfounded and apologetic--yet he never brought a slice of bacon to garnish the drink, nor did he offer us another Bloody Mary. Huh?\n\nHe redeemed himself, however, when he brought us a quarter of a fresh pineapple studded with fresh strawberries that we hadn't ordered. He explained that when he'd seen the pitiful 1/4 cup of barely-ripe cantaloupe the chef had put on the pass, he'd said he couldn't serve just that to us.\n\nI'd be willing to try Bacon again when I'm in town next, especially since they included a $5 off coupon with our check, but neither the food nor the service stood out on this visit.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BK51tV_XtCm3UHwRVyCuqQ"}

I recently went in to acquire a Valentines Day gift for my little one and was, once again, treated with unfriendly service. They are in their new location and hadn't yet unpacked everything. The guy behind the counter acted annoyed and told me to look around for what I was looking for. He did not offer to track it down for me or call the dealer who sells the line. He also did not seem knowledgeable on the collection itself. Okay, I guess he can't know everything in his store. But what about taking my number and finding out? It does, after all, bring you business to make your customers happy. After wasting about 20 minutes of my time in a store that clearly did not care about whether they got my business, I left. I will never go back in which is too bad because I purchased 3 actions figures for my daughter here on 3 separate occasions. I mean, I know they are individual dealers but shouldn't they all care about bringing in business? Anyway, I went home disgusted and bought 2 actions figures online rather than in their store. I will not recommend this place to anyone. I really wanted to give my business to a local place and the actual dealer who sells the line is lovely (have only met him once) while in the store. I should have asked for his number then because you never know when the dealers will be there.  Oh well, sorry dealer guy.

Suggestion to the owner - stay open later and give Hooters some competition!\n\nOverall, this is a decent place to hangout and have a few drinks.  They also have weekday happy hour specials like ladies night on Thursday.", "type": "review", "business_id": "supigcPNO9IKo6olaTNV-g"}

I would like to give them 5 stars because we have seen this place at its best and they rock. However, there are times they make Pizza Hut seem like an upgrade. McDonald's makes millions not by making a great hamburger, but by making a consistently bad burger. You know what to expect, and the expectation is consistently met. \n\nOur family and friends incorporated this restaurant into our routine and have been there many times. Occasionally we'll have them deliver, but usually we hang out there. They make a good pizza at a fair price. Place is generally well kept and service is friendly and courteous. You can watch the Diamondbacks AND Suns while the kids watch Nick on the big screen. It's a family restaurant and you are likely to experience someone testing boundaries. If you can't stand being exposed to the process of child rearing they deliver. \n\nYou are reading this because you should be forewarned: When they are busy they are not very good. The timing is off, the food quality is poor... ok, they're bad. Yogi Berra once said of a popular restaurant: \"Nobody goes there no more, it's too crowded!\" If you can walk up to the counter and order, then easily find a table - you'll enjoy the experience. If there is a line and no tables - it's a gamble. \nIf you've been and left without joy, give them a try when they're not weeded. \n\nRecommend light sauce and extra cheese with whatever toppings appeal to you. \nGluten free unlikely to affect you appetite, tastes good enough to add a pant size.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EQTdq1SJuU6bjC3myEfDWg"}

It's not too far from my house, and the prices didn't look to bad. Plus, they had a happy hour. Score!\n\nWhen we got there, it wasn't too busy, which is good. There must've been a memo I didn't get about screaming children though. I'm all for family restaurants, but this restaurant is actually pretty tiny, and the tables are smooshed together. We had the lucky opportunity to sit next to the loudest of the kids, so the first half of our visit was not great. \n\nOur waitress, that's another review all on its own. I don't know why, but I have an issue with restaurant dress codes. I don't need to see a girl wearing shorts so short that the bottom of her bum is sticking out. This was pretty much all of the female staff. She greeted us right away, which was good, but then it took about 10 minutes for ice water . . . then she only took one alcohol order. I had said I wasn't sure what I wanted, but she didn't come back for another fifteen or so minutes. That was annoying. She was pretty absent from then on. refills were sporadic, so we had to hold on to what we had. Not sure when the next refill would come.\n\nWhen we finally got to ordering (I'll admit it took us awhile because we are pretty chatty) I was famished. I ordered mac n cheese (duh) and everyone else ordered a burger. The mac n cheese I ordered had broccoli and chicken in it, my favorite combination. However, when the mean came out, for some reason there was no chicken in it . . . and the cheese had hardened on the top, which makes me think it had been sitting for a while before being brought out. The waitress noticed I had no chicken, so she brought me out a piece on grilled chicken on a side plate. This was the tiniest, thinnest, piece of 'chicken' i've ever seen.\n\nThe food was tasty however, so no complaints (minus no chicken and cold mac n cheese).\n\nAll in all, probably would come again, but not for beer, it was very expensive, (between 4 of us, we had bout 12 beers and it was $90 during happy hour?). I also would probably not recommend it unless you are prepared for the unwatched screaming children and over priced beer.", "type": "review", "business_id": "umdxfhSlk67yGEi8-S-bEg"}

They have a great menu of plates, and you can tell that people line up for the flavor. I've had several omelets of theirs, with my most recent dish being overeasy huevos with a salsa-style ranchero sauce over jalapeno cornbread.

The service, food, drinks, and ambiance were all spectacular.\n\nFirst, the drinks. There are numerous specialty cocktails, an extensive wine list, draft and bottled beers, aperitif, digestif, single malt scotch, and almost every type of alcohol you could expect. Even unexpected libations that I rarely see elsewhere, such as dessert wines. We had to try their signature cocktails because it seemed to be the right thing to do at CPH. Good booze & good bartenders; can't let those go to waste. We had to have something with gin, so we opted for Aviation & Count Negroni. Both were what we expected. Strong & unique. I don't see anyone disliking Aviation, but Count Negroni is for specific tastes. Try this if you like strong orange and cinnamon flavors. The Campari in this drink makes a statement.\n\nSecond, the food. We ordered the \"Smart Chicken\" and the Berkshire Pork Loin. The chicken had a nice crispiness on the outside and had the flavor of lightly fried chicken without all the fat. The risotto, mushrooms, and onions that came with it were amazing.\n\nNow, the pork. The pork! This experience made me fall in love with pork all over again. We all love bacon, but the bland white pork that comes from industrial farms has destroyed its reputation with people who love pork for its flavor, not for its leanness. Granted, I have never had Berkshire pork before this visit, but it was absolutely amazing. They cooked it perfectly. Pink and moist on the inside. The meat was so sweet & tender and the fat was so flavorful. This is due to the quality of Berkshire pork, but also the proper preparation. The stone fruit compote complemented the sweetness of the pork perfectly, as did the pistachios. The gorgonzola/white corn spoon bread was awesome. And the broccoli rabe/chard (couldn't tell exactly what it was) was steamed perfectly with great seasoning and flavor.\n\nThird, the dessert. The bread pudding was fantastic! Like the best apple pie you've ever eaten...only better. The ice cream that came with it was great as well. I ordered a cup of coffee as well, from Roastery of Cave Creek called \"Black and Tan.\" One of the better cups of coffee I've ever had. Even my girlfriend enjoyed it, and it had no cream or sugar. She usually loads up the sugar in coffee but she said that the coffee has so much flavor that it doesn't need anything.\n\nFourth, the service. Our server, Brian, was very knowledgeable and very courteous. He answered every question we had, gave us the proper attention, and made sure we enjoyed our experience. I can't remember a recent experience with better service than we had here at CPH.\n\nOverall, everything you want in a restaurant. It's in a great location, in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale. I can't compliment this place enough. Just go!", "type": "review", "business_id": "MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA"}

They have the best Vietnamese food that I've found in the valley, and I've tried the majority of the Vietnamese restaurants in the heavily Asian part of Chandler (Cyclo, Pho Van, Anise, etc.).  The pho here is absolutely terrific and is really packed full of flavor.  The other dishes I've tried have also all been fantastic, and everyone I've taken here has absolutely loved it.  Seriously, nobody has had a bad dish or a bad experience.  The staff is extremely friendly and if you have questions about anything, they'll spend as much time as you need helping you out, even though it might be in slightly broken English.  Add on to all of this that you can get a huge bowl of pho for $7 and there's really nothing bad that can be said about this place.\n\nGuess what else?  They have boba tea.  I was concerned that when I was living in North Phoenix for a few weeks I wouldn't be able to get boba tea as easily as I could in Chandler, but Pho Avina once again saves the day.  Their boba is a little bit softer than I prefer, but it's still good and definitely worth getting.\n\nFinally, if you're feeling really adventurous, Pho Avina has both durian boba tea and durian ice cream.  I haven't checked, but they may even be able to bring you a small plate of durian if you ask nicely.  For those who don't know, durian is a fruit that grows in Southeast Asia and is known for having one of the most foul odors of anything in the world.  Durians smell so bad that some Asian countries have banned them from subways and other public places, similar to smoking bans.  People either love them or hate them - I personally think durian tastes like a mix of rotten onions and garlic, so I'm not a big fan.  A friend of mine thinks they taste like a mix of feet and death and actually instantly threw up the first time he bit into a piece of the fruit.  Still though, some people absolutely love durian, and it's definitely something worth trying once in your life.\n\nThis place has it all, and although I'm moving out of Phoenix in just a few days, I'm going to make damn sure that I visit Pho Avina every time I come back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tqDwpyCB53TiEIv915Tuww"}

I've been driving past it on my way to and from work for ages but never had the time to stop in.  I have friends who rave about the place and go regularly, so I really wanted to check it out.  I finally did this past Saturday (5/31) and I scolded myself for not having done so sooner.\n\nMy friend and I found a parking space out back in the tiny parking lot and walked in not really knowing what to expect.  One patron sat at a table with her laptop and the rest of the place was empty.  The friendly girl at the counter took our orders and gave her own recommendations for cool drinks.  I took her up on her suggestion of a peach smoothie.  It was wonderful - like drinking pureed peaches!  I took a sip of my friend's latte and knew I would be ordering one of my own at some point in the near future.  Before taking our drinks, my eyes lingered over the cupcakes on display; I must admit I drooled a bit.\n\nBecause it was such a nice night, we sat outside and enjoyed our drinks.  It wasn't long before more people showed up.  A group of older folks joined us outside and a few other groups and couple settled inside.  My mind kept going back to the cupcakes I saw earlier, and I ended up going inside to buy one.  My choices were vanilla, red velvet, lemon, and strawberry (I think).  Not only were the cupcakes quite sizeable, but they had sprinkles - goldfish and piggies!  Very nice touch.  I ended up selecting a vanilla funfetti cupcake with bright blue icing and goldfish sprinkles.  It wasn't anything spectacular - just a cupcake made from a box cake mix - but it was a very nice treat and that much more special due to the fishies.  I know - it doesn't take much to make me happy.\n\nI've since been back twice and have used the very convenient drive-thru.  The first time, the man who came out to greet me asked if I had my stamp card after he took my order.  When I told him I didn't, he told me he would give me one, and he did - along with three stamps!  that morning I had another peach smoothie and decided to try the red velvet cupcake.  The smoothie was just as ood as the first, but this cupcake was VERY tasty - much better than the vanilla funfetti.  I stopped again this morning and ordered a vanilla latte.  That sucker far surpassed the vanilla lattes I usually get at Starbucks.\n\nI love supporting local businesses, and I'm only too happy to return to Copper Star time and again.

Well, I'm happy to tell you that after going to 75th Thai Taste with my friend tonight, I am a fellow fan of Thai food!\n\nAs I pulled up to the restaurant I noticed a small Mexican joint next to it, and the Mexican blood flowing through my veins pumped a little faster as I considered the possibility of eating Mexican instead.  However, I was determined to get a taste of Thai at 75th Thai Taste (plus I had a good friend whom I haven't seen in a while waiting for me inside).\n\nAs I entered the door I noticed right away how clean the restaurant was.  I also noticed that the tables and chairs were not the same mundane fast-food-type furniture.  On the contrary, the furniture was different and inviting.\n\nMy second observation was the glass of water my friend had in which a slice of lime was floating.  I've never seen that before, as most restaurants use slices of lemon, but I was excited because I delight in the taste of lime more than I do that of lemons.\n\nAs I browsed the menu I noticed many entrees that I wanted to try, however I made the decision to order the Stir Fried Asparagus with beef; it also came with steamed rice.\n\nI didn't wait long at all before the food arrived.  The portion of food on the plate looked like more than I could handle -- it was a very generous portion!  :-)  Green asparagus along with red and green bell peppers freckled the brown beef.  It looked delicious, so I dug right in!\n\nThe first bite had me hooked.  I surprised myself by eating the whole meal, but it was too delicious to save until later!\n\nI give 75th Thai Taste 5 stars.

Their mannequins have gigantic titties and weird S&M bikinis on and everyone there is pretty much playing the part of a pothead.  \"Whoa... you're gonna buy this?

I just wanna grab a pipe and duck out.\n\nOverall, I have to give them three stars because the service is, apart for the sales techniques, very friendly and knowledgeable and the overall decor, though kind of a cliche, is at least pleasant to the eyes and I feel like I can roll in high without having a bum jack off in the corner.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tJvz7EclpVO8tErXEJ4Drw"}

Their menu is quite extensive offering things like  an extra 5 minutes massage, shea butter lotion, etc, all for minimal additional costs.\n\nWhen I book a pedicure I assume it includes soak, massage, lotion, etc and I would rather pay $75 for a full pedicure than have to \"create\" one that starts at $20 and after I add on all the \"extras\" that are normally included,  it's $75 anyway. I know this may sound negative but it isn't intended to be so let me go forward.\n\nMy personal peeve is that I don't like nickel & diming so give me a price and I will pay for the service. BUT...Teres had some of the nicest people working there and it was absolutely beautiful. The colors, the feel, the energy were all wonderful and the two young women who did me and my friend's pedicure were so sweet and fun. Once we figured out what we wanted, it was a great pedicure. I loved the nail color choices and thank you to the receptionist who was so patient and wore a welcoming smile.\n\nWould I return? ABSOLUTELY! I'm sure this kind of a la carte service is where the new generation is going and, although it isn't my favorite way, it is still a great place to go and unwind. My advice? If you are a dinosaur like me, run by a few days before (or go online) and look at their menu so you know what you want before you go.

Both had great suggestions and they were more than happy to accommodate our gluten free requests (FYI - they have tamari in house).

These are not large portions and we were starving, but everything was delicious! \n\nWe then moved to sushi were the BF found a common love for special salts (pink, house made curry, black volcanic, green team and finally truffle) with the manager! From that point on, we were hooked on this place! We had the spicy scallop roll and the salmon/avocado roll. Both were amazing, especially the salmon which was sensational. \n\nFrom there, we took a pause before the final round! As we were watching the sushi chef, he created an off-the menu steak tartare nigiri style with a cracked quail egg...the manager insisted we try it and it was fantastic! Such a delight!\n\nAfter some more time to digest, we decided to go with the Yuzu Marinated Black Cod....this was a first for me and OMG! I am a huge fan! Buttery, melt in your mouth amazing fish! We also ordered some rice and veggies on the side, but the chef came over and advised us to a sampler instead, especially so there was no gluten in the veggies. Out comes a buffet of yummy items off the grill...zucchini's with lemon, tempura veggies (not GF though), and my oh my the asparagus! This was all just fantastic! \n\nWe couldn't get out without a little GF cake and finally, finally, we rolled outta there after 3 and half hours of shear delight!

With the weather cooling off their patio is really cozy and they have a live acoustic band out there to set the mood.  Really chill.  \n\nAmbiance-So there is a more formal dining area in 1 part of the restaurant and then there is a dining area by the bar, and some couches and chairs even for group gatherings.  Then there's tables for dining outside.  What can I say, they have 3 cool areas depending on your crew and mood you are in.  The bar has many chairs you can belly up to and the bartender that I encountered was so nice it caught me off guard! Kudos to service there! The decor is very much wine bar-centric and many cool pictures on the walls.  A very relaxing setting.  \n\nCuisine-They offer 6 types of bruschetta as well as a variety of meats and cheeses with their antipasto selections.  Great to pair with their extensive wine by the glass selections.  Both I've had and they are amazing! I can't speak to the entree's because if I'm trying different wines I'm  into more of pairing/small plate type of mood.  Had the chop salad as an appetizer and that was delicious as well.  \n\nService-Right as you walk in the hostess is right there to greet you and ask you where you'd like to sit.  As I stated above, more of the formal dining area, casual dining area, bar, or patio all open as options. (if place isn't packed of course)  The wait staff and bartender are really personable and happy to address any questions regarding the wine or food.  Service was very prompt as well.  \n\nOverall I give this place the highest rating because all of the aforementioned criteria.  If you feel likewise by all means, check it out.

We arrived and was greeted by a gentleman that I wasn't sure if he worked there or not, but soon it would turn out he was our server for the evening. \n\nHe was very attentive and answered any and all question we might have had, even though the answers was straight off the menus description of the same items. But he took our drink order, and brought it out shortly. From this moment he circled our table and frequently stopped by, asking if we wanted to put in a entr\u00e9e-order - right after we have got our very extensive appetizer selection. (I found this very odd, because there is no way that we would been even halfway done with our apps before our entr\u00e9e would have been ready.) From this minute our waiter stopped checking on us, in fact he might have left the restaurant, and we had no service at all. \n\n*Food\nI imagined this to be a culinary gem, but as nice as their cheeses are.. I must say I was greatly disappointed in the meal; most of all the hyped Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue. I cannot believe how this is raved about. The soft pretzels are most certainly not baked on the premises, and the Fondue could be made my Kraft. Shitty shitty shitty and overpriced. \n\n*Service\nA place like CD needs to have great to outstanding service, but I found it to be the crappiest experience I have ever had in Scottsdale. Our snot nosed waited should be fired, and the rest of the eclectic bunch are so inattentive when we tried to flag them down, mainly for the check once we had been ignored for an hour. AN HOUR! \n(By eclectic, I mean that it is hard to see who is working there due to the extreme casual dress-suggestion of the waitstaff. Normally I am all for this, because you usually can pick out the waiters/waitresses by behavior and attitude. Nopes!)\n\n*Ambiance\nHere is the stars! It's a nice big place CD have here in Scottsdale, and even if I think the chandeliers is a bit much I like the layout and the bar area very much. Even the furniture. This is nice on many levels. This is where I give two stars, since the rest is extremely overrated. \n\n*Overall\nThe food is substandard, and I tried all over the appetizers. All over. I mean the Entrees could technically be divine, but then you might have to order it straight to the chef and pick it up yourself. I would have loved to have spoken to a manager about the lack of service - but the absence of service even made this into a mission for Ethan Hawke (if he'd choose to accept it). \n\nI will not come back. Unless it is to have a dinner meeting with a manager.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xY1sPHTA2RGVFlh5tZhs9g"}

It was suggested that the prime rib would be the best option so I ordered the 7 oz, medium (using their menu-rankings and descriptions as a guide), plus the usual sides.\n\nWhat I got was essentially steak tartar, with a millimeter-thick quick sear on the outside.  On first bite I wasn't sure what I was eating, so I had a second.  Then it became apparent that the middle of the steak was not only rare, it was completely raw .. basically refrigerator-cold to the tongue.\n\nSo, steak sashimi not being what I wanted I waited for the server to return.  This didn't happen so I got up and went searching through the restaurant, to no avail.  I finally just stood in the middle of a busy intersection until one passed by, and explained the situation.  He could not find our server either so agreed to take it back for 'reheating'.\n\nA few minutes later someone higher up came and apologized and said another would would be right up.  The rest of our party continued to dine while I sat there with no dining whatsoever, no refills on water/drink etc.  About 20 minutes later my food arrived (45 mins after ordering), and everyone else was most way through theirs.  \n\nWith wine glass completely empty, no service for refills forthcoming, I proceeded into steak #2 with just a glass of water.\n\nSteak #2 was marginally better, but in lieu of medium it was just well done on the outer ring and again, all-rare tartar in the middle.\n\nI gave up after a few bites, just surrendered the meal altogether and just went to a taco take-out on the way back to the hotel.\n\nI didn't do an exhaustive review of the check but it did not look like anything was comped, though the restaurant put in a $25 gift card for a future visit.  This I regarded as a final insult, as I have no desire to return to this place and in lieu of making up for the bad meal and poor service, the only apparent apology is an invitation to come back and do it all over again.\n\nI hope others have a better experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xMK01ZbVUYLLoyqoeWAIVw"}

The guacamole was about average...nothing special (ours also had cranberries instead of the pomegranate seeds) .  The Pollo Poblano was definitely a better dish than the Pescado del Mar....tender chicken and a pretty good sauce.  The Pescado del Mar was the disappointing part of the meal.  The dish was served warm (not hot by any means) and the seafood was cooked inconsistently...the shrimp and lobster were fine, but the halibut and scallops were cooked unevenly (some parts were fine, while others seemed undercooked).

I mean I was just their a few weeks ago and I remembered just how yummy the food was at the event so I just had to go back.\n\nThe place was packed! I mean it was Friday night so I didn't expect anything less but wow. We had two choices, to either wait 45 mins for a table or grab a table near the bar. We choose the latter as the you still received the full menu at the bar as well.\n\nWe were greeted pretty quickly and our waitress, Deanna took great care of us. Hats off to you Deanna! You rocked girl.\n\nMy friend started off with a raspberry mojito I believe (I am not sure but I think that is what it was), Lobster Bisque and Snapper with Crab, the crab fried rice to share and some steamed asparagus. All I wanted was the calamari  so I ordered that as my main course. I know lame but that is all I had a taste for as I was saving room for dessert too.\n\nSo her drink, some warm fresh bread, and the lobster bisque came pretty quickly.  After that we are not sure what happened. One of the waiters (who by the way remembered me from the yelp event) came over to see how our meal was and we told him that we hadn't eaten yet. No sooner did we say that did our meal finally arrive. We were not upset by the delay at all as we were catching up on old times but it was a pretty long wait. However the manager Mario came over to apologize about the delay and offered to by us dessert. How cool was that. Deanna also came over to apologize as well for not checking on us sooner. \n\nThe meal was so good. My friend enjoyed hers and I chowed down on all that yummy calamari. It was a huge plate that was sitting on top vegetables, red chiles and some yummy but spicy cashews. I also had some of that crab fried rice which was also very good. Lots of crab and lots of mushrooms. Yummy.  To save room for dessert we ate as much as we could but then requested to pack up the rest so that we could enjoy the grand finale.\n\nOMG! The desserts are sinful. My friend ordered the upside pineapple cake made with fresh whipped cream and vanilla bean ice cream, and I had the chocolate godiva cake that was served warm with vanilla bean ice cream. Good lawd those desserts were good. If you don't want anything else from this restaurant. which shame on you for not trying the delicious food, at least go for dessert. Yum, yum, yum.\n\nAll in all it was a great time. Thank you again to Deanna and huge extra special thank you to Mario for generously buying us dessert. I will definitely be back again soon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8t80-omyflkywRfu9LPh6g"}

For the hell of it, we decided on day one to identify the very best Creme Brulee in Paris. We ordered Creme Brulee after dinner, we ordered it after lunch, we even picked up a few Creme Brulee's at popular patisserie's throughout the city. Our Creme Brulee's would make their way around our table and we would discuss the merits of each. We analyzed those little euro custards as if we were trying to impress an eavesdropping Anthony Bourdain. Did we prefer it with or without vanilla beans? Warm or cold? Deep remekin or shallow? When it was all said and done, we found the best. \n\nBelieve it or not, we did the same thing in a little Mexican village called San Miguel de Allende. Only this time it wasn't Creme Brulee... it was Chilaquiles. When our trip was over I assumed that we found the best in San Miguel, possibly even the best in the world. I was wrong. Whatever we deemed superior in San Miguel was completely outmatched by the Chilaquiles I had last Friday evening at Gallo Blanco. Simply amazing. A perfect blend of savory, spicy chile with the faintest hint of citrusy sweetness. It had a wonderful contrast of various textures, and just enough crispiness on the top layer to make me forget the failed excessively soggy versions of my past.

Oh no! Judging from our hysterical reactions, you'd have thought we just received the worst news of our lives. Man, were we bummed! At this point, we had been craving a hot dog for the better part of the day; so much so that any other type of food was just simply not going to cut it. I'm not kidding, you could have put a filet mignon in front of our faces and we would have passed. We wanted some dogs!! (And not just any old crappy hot dog). \n\nLuckily for us, we knew about Maui Dog and headed right over. We were charmed right off the bat with the colorful exterior and handwritten drive through menu. The inside is just as fun and quirky as the outside with surfboards and random Hawaiian decor abounding from floor to ceiling. The owner struck us as a very cool ex-hippy type dude who was very nice and accommodating. We ordered three dogs in total; one Hana dog, one Sweet and Spicy dog and another beef dog that we topped with pretty much every topping available. These dogs are definitely not your grandma's hot dog! The combination of tropical toppings such as coconut, mango and pineapple colliding with the juicy meat of the dog was a perfect mixture of sweet, salty and spicy. I think the Hana dog was my personal favorite, but I don't think you could go wrong with any dog here. And don't let me forget to mention the fries! They were out of tater tots that day, but the fries were just as amazing, hand cut and freshly made, we couldn't have asked for a better compliment to go with our dogs. \n\nTempted to give this place 5 stars, but we're going to hold off for now until we can go back and try some more creations on the menu and hopefully get our hands on some of those tots!  This place definitely lives up to the hype, so the next time you're craving a new age dog head on over and show them some Yelp love!", "type": "review", "business_id": "t4aP7ksa716XY6S4EsWFqw"}

So much so, I ended up visiting three times in one week :)  [Unfortunately, I only have photos from the first two visits, as I had misplaced my SD card after the third].  Wow, where do I start?  The front of the venue reminds me of an AJ's Fine Foods, or a (very) mini-Whole Foods: there's the bread aisle to your right as you walk in, cash registers to your left, and straight ahead is the cold food section where you may find deli side items (along w/ roasted veggies and crisp asparagus spears), as well as prepared paninis, which they'll grill for you, if you want.  Try the white cheddar w/ truffled butter on sourdough- to die for!  I get it EVERY time, no matter what else may strike my fancy during my stay here (and I'm here for HOURS, no exaggeration).  Beside and behind this deli counter are cases of pastries and pies, charcuterie products, and cheese!  There is also a soup kiosk, as well as a sandwich station.  There is a self-serve dining section in this room, w/ a couch, or two, and coffee table, as well as bar-height tables and chairs, and a couple of electric sockets to plug into while you utilize free wi-fi!  While the sandwich maker will happily oblige you in slicing a loaf of bread you picked up from the many shelves and even toast a few slices for you to have w/ the half-pound of Tuscan chicken salad you sampled first at the deli counter, make no mistake in thinking you'll be able to flag someone down as you dine at the self-service area.  Once you pay for your items, you're on your own.\n\nIf it's effusive service you want, head over to the back of the restaurant where you'll find a wine bar to your left, a lovely dining area in the middle, and a bar counter to the right.  There's even patio dining in the back, but it was too cold to even consider that option then.  You'll find live music between 6p and 9p on Friday nights.  The times I spent there, the group Slave to the Groove played.  One of the two musicians used to be a chef :)  In between the sections of self- and full-service, you'll find a coffee bar, featuring Portland Roasting Company coffee, where you may also purchase pastries, such as muffins, cookies, and scones, and to its right, you will find the pizza/hot grill station, where pizzaiolos/cooks busily prepare your pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, or even roast prime rib while you wait!  (The lay-out of TK is, to me, nicely done.  I wish my home could feel like this!  Oh, and did I mention there is free wi-fi??  Not hard to imagine that I've spent hours here, now, is it?)\n\nBefore I go on and on, let me just list a few items I really enjoyed: \n\n1. White cheddar panini w/ truffled butter, $4 (don't forget to have it pressed!).  Perfect w/ that $5 glass of wine during happy hour.\n2. Prosciutto, goat cheese, fig, and arugula bruschetta w/ aged balsamic vinaigrette- a great deal on their happy hour menu!\n3. Apple crumble w/ vanilla-bean ice cream!\n\np.s.  Their caffe latte is superb!  I have it w/out sugar, so that I can justify splurging on a cookie (or two!)- the white chocolate macadamia nut or the oatmeal-raisin pairs up well.  (I'd pass on the chocolate chip cookie- the chips used aren't of great quality, IMHO).   \n\nWhether you're here for lunch, happy hour, coffee break, or dinner, you'll find The Kitchen a worthwhile choice.  (Did I mention they also serve breakfast?  Menu looks divine; I haven't been, but if someone sets up a breakfast UYE here, I'll try my best to attend!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "TBfOrA3_4u38rFrF7LwU0A"}

It seats a lot of people, and it's very rowdy and VERY loud. It is the least traditional golf environment you could imagine, and it's a lot of fun.\n\nUpon teeing off, the players are met with either rousing cheers or loud boos, depending on where their tee shots land. The crowd screams at the caddies, trying to get them to sprint up onto the green. If they ever do, the crowd goes wild. If there's a great shot, the crowd goes wild. Some golfers throw gear into the crowd, and they go wild. The moral of the story here is that it's wild. \n\nThere are private areas and spaces for corporate sponsors, which would be the way to be here, if you can find a way in. When I come back next year, I'll likely spend the vast majority of my time at the 16th hole. It's so much fun, and also a drunken shit show with all the lushes around you.\n\nSome advice...Get here early, because they'll start running a line.

The original is a 9 inch (I think) roll with sliced rib-eye, grilled onions, and cheese whiz... holy cow, it was delicious. The meat was tender, not stringy or chewy and had enough flavor to make it through both the cheese and the onions, which were just wonderful icing on the cake. The roll was firm enough to hold up to all the juices, yet was soft and tasted very fresh. The sweet potato fries also blew me away, they were not overly fried by any means, just enough to be hot and steaming and were wonderfully sweet. The owner convinced me to take a side of honey mustard to dip them in, and it was a terrific choice. The dressing added a little sweetness, but the mustard added just enough tang to produce a delightful symphony between the two.

They have the old reliables like the Kim Crawford Sav Blanc.  They even have -- and I'm very impressed by this -- Cakebread Vineyards Chard!  Now, granted, I'm not keen on throwing down $70 for a bottle, nor is it really in my disposable budget when two bottles of the Sav Blanc will suffice; but if we are talking about a special occasion, THAT is your bottle.\n\nThe cheese list is exhaustive and very impressive.  I wish I knew more about cheeses and pairings to offer a helpful review, but the pairings that were suggested by the waiter were perfect.  You can see their cheese menu online and its worth researching before you go so you'll know your varieties.\n\nThe thing that bothers me about Cheuvront, however, is their chronic lack of atmosphere.  First, it kind of feels like drinking in the lobby of an airport.  There just isn't a ton of ambiance.  While I do enjoy the lighting, the brightness reflecting off of the concrete mess that is Central Ave is just really uncomfortable when you are trying to enjoy a bottle.  Where as Pacifico pairs beautifully with the sunny deck of a pool, I count on dim, moody lighting for a bottle of Pinot.  \n\nFurthermore, the place is just usually dead, no excitement, or aura.  Its bright, lacks energy, and the seating is mostly awkward.  This place deserves an inspired crowd, but I've yet to see it yet.  The mood even trickles, up/down to the staff who seem to be going through some of the motions.  I don't know, maybe its just my perception.  I think a lot of it has to do with the enormous amount of spacing between tables, and of course, the trepidation of those couches that seem to infiltrate all posh valley spots.  Ugh.

Picture a Blue Bombay bottle reduced by 50%. That's Air Blue. If you want more information about it then Google Llumar Air Blue to compare it to classic charcoal tints. Personally, I would have loved a Classic 50 (TM) on my windshield because, unlike many people, I do like the \"cave\" feeling of a tinted car, but 1. I'm moving out of state in 5 days and Danny's is first-come first served; 2. I'm single and in PHX temporarily with no family or friends here and have to wait on my car as its being serviced AND I work M-F from 8-5; 3. I'm 1/2 worried I won't be able to see out of a Classic 50 at night even with my Sylvania Silver Star Ultra headlight bulbs. \n\nI asked the guy on the phone (Matt?), \"Does the $250 cover everything?\" He said, and I quote, \"Yes.\"  I should have asked, \"Does the $250 include Arizona sales tax?\" I then asked him, \"How long will it take?\" He replied, \"About an hour for windshields\" I arrived on a Saturday morning at 7:15am so I'd be first in line. At 8am, the attendant opened for business and I told him I'd been there since 7:15am so I could be first in line. He then said that Saturdays were their busiest days and Danny's suggests that people drop their cars off and return later for pick-up. I then explained to him that that was impossible. He said it would take about an hour and with tax would total $275. REALLY? I got a quote at Cactus for $225 but they're by appointment only and were booked.\n\n At 9:30am, I went to the tinting area and inquired about my car because it was way past time. They said it would be ready by 10am. At 9:50am, they called me from the lobby and I inspected my windshield. At first glance, it looked great! I could tell that a tint had been applied yet I could see through it easily. Air Blue! \n\nAs I prepared to leave, I noticed that my cup holders had about 1/4 inch of water in them. Then I looked up and noticed my rear-view mirror had water spots all over it. I'm thankful for spotting the water spots because then I noticed that my electrified rear-view mirror electrical cord was still UNattached and taped to the ceiling. I got nervous, and really inspected my windshield. That's when I noticed a few little bubbles, a few weird faint bubble-lines that look almost like stretch marks, and a scratch that could have been caused by a fingernail. (Update: After 24 hours in the sun, all the bubbles tightened up as did the \"stretch marks.\" Looks great!)\n\n I went back in and got a technician. I showed him the electrical cord and the scratch. He said they'd re-do the tint if I wanted. I declined because I was tired and lived 30 minutes away. I just wanted to go home. I'd been there for 3 hours--and hour longer than estimated by the tint manager (Matt?). This time when I left, a technician (Matt?) followed me out and told me that the bubbles should tighten up in the sun over the course of the day, especially the ones on the dotted 3rd visor and dotted/frit edge of the passenger-side. If they tighten up, I'll update you. \n\nDriving away from Danny's on Bell, the first thing I noticed was how clear the Air Blue tint was. I wear polarized, prescription sun glasses and, at times, see pink & lime stripes in my charcoal tint--if not rainbow-flaring. With Air Blue, I don't get any kind of visual feedback. It's nice. It's still really bright, but I can't complain about Air Blue. I just wish the installation tech hadn't been so sloppy WITH THE TINT and that Matt? had been more clear about pricing and more honest about the estimated wait time. That's why they're not getting 5 stars--customer service and technician conscientiousness. However, Air Blue is good stuff and gets 5 stars---if its what you're looking for.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wKXHOkQropo-YG60OvN6Uw"}

While MGC does cater to families each table feels secluded and you can take in the nature and beauty of the farm, not to mention eat and chat in peace. Another reason for picking MGC is their use of local sustainable ingredients. As a vegetarian I think its really important to support local farmers so I am happy to see this trend picking up in AZ. I enjoyed the white truffle egg skillet with local veggies, it was phenomenal. Being veg I can sometimes get shafted by just eggs and toast dishes or the occasional bland omlette but this dish was so flavorful and full of deliciously chopped veggies (I know I saw some potatoes, cauliflower, bell pepper and green onion to name a few).

They sent a winter wonderland package - cost on website $29.95. They didn't send me any sort of notification that they ran out of my item or that they would be sending an alternate item. Usually when you do this, you send an item of GREATER, not LESSER value. I emailed on a Wednesday about the mixup, no response until I sent a followup email on Saturday. Customer Service rep said that they did respond but couldn't prove it - she just got argumentative on the phone. Basically, she said that they have every right to send a replacement item even if it is of lower value and that this is posted on their website. I couldn't find the notice on their website - but who sends a lower value item and then doesn't credit the difference? They said I have to buy something else and they will credit the $4 difference to me on my next order. NO apologies for the error, just a stubborn attitude from Jennifer - the customer service rep. No thanks. Won't be buying from them ever again!\n\nShe then couldn't assure me that the gifts I sent to others in my other orders were actually the correct gifts ... I have my doubts based on them messing up 2 of my orders, so will stay away from using them for gift orders ever again.\n\n(Mistake 2) Had to change the shipping address on a order. They did change the shipping address on that order correctly, however, they also mistakenly changed the address on another order (the order # is 2 digits off on the end). When I brought this up to them - again, no response via email until I emailed twice. They were nice enough to admit the mistake and then ship out a new package to the correct address. However, when I spoke to the customer service rep today - she basically said I lied on that order to get 2 packages of brownies shipped to me for the price of 1 and has emailed proof that I asked for the order address to be changed. Yeah, I asked for the address to be changed - ONLY on one order though and NOT both where they changed the address. Customer service rep said she had the email where I asked for it, but I don't have the email (and I have gmail where I can sort by the order number and see all emails with that # in the email body) and she basically just kept insinuating I was a liar. Basically, they erroneously changed the order shipping address on both orders instead of just 1 like I asked and now said it was my fault for the mistake.\n\nGood brownies, but not worth the hassle and definitely not worth being treated like dirt. \n\nJust wanted to make sure people knew how they treat customers!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "E2F25cRcYf_bWtvbCht0EQ"}

My boyfriend and I went to Su Vino winery right before they were closing & needed to find a new place to eat so I pulled up Trip Advisor & found F&B had amazing reviews.  As we walked in I thought the place was really cute, it was really eclectic & looked very down to earth.\n\nWe sat down & were asking questions to the waitress because their drink menu is a bit confusing.  She seemed a little impatient with us but then would go to the table next to us (an older couple) and be so friendly & nice... seemed really odd.  I got the impression that maybe she thought they would spend more & tip her better but we spent over $200 on our meal so I would think that deserves a little attention.  I advise all younger patrons to try not to sit in the section of the early 30's blonde waitresses, unless you want rude service.\n\nThe food was not really that spectacular either.  The ambiance gives you the impression of a farm fresh type cuisine but the steak we had was not impressive at all.  Grass fed beef is really my favorite because it tends to just melt in your mouth but it didn't taste much better than something you would buy in the butcher section of your grocery store.  We ordered the falafel (probably the best out of everything), sunchokes (very weird it almost tastes like a potato/artichoke & I definitely do not recommend this) it tasted very unhealthy & they gave you way too much.\n\nI would have to say that the absolute worst part for me was the dessert, of all things this should be executed perfectly because that's the last thing you eat before you leave.  I originally ordered the trip chocolate souffle cake & was sooooo excited, what a joke!!  I have made souffle many times & it is very difficult but what they served was not souffle it tasted like they pulled an old dessert out of the refrigerator, dumped Hershey syrup on it & served it.  It was dense, cold & dry... YUCK!!!  I took one bite & could not eat another, after 20 minutes of our dessert sitting their uneaten the waitress finally came back to check on us & I ordered the Butterscotch Pudding (their signature dessert) & the waitress said, \"oh you decided to try that too?\"  She brought it out & then dropped off our check.  Okay here's a little Serving 101, if somebody orders dessert & doesn't eat it & then orders another dessert you may want to ask if something was wrong???  Not just ignore the table & then drop off the check to avoid having a conversation or to remove an item... who does that???  I then told her that I didn't like the dessert & to please remove it.  After 2.5 hours, a few courses, $240 (with tip) later I was glad to leave.  I will not be returning or recommending this place in the future, in fact I've told a few people already not to waste their time in trying it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IuAPYzf3NSyfyXYgT46YVA"}

Being a bit later than usual (walked in around 830p) a buffet like this may have been the only thing that could properly stave off my hunger. The place was fairly jam packed this Friday night, and a decent portion were of Asian descent (good sign).\n\n  A previous Yelp raised suspicions on whether this place would even deliver on the legs once it got late, and a few people waiting by the empty station had me worried a little at first... until a cook came through those doors wielding a big pot full of bright red steamy shells. Even being of the first pair of people to load my plate I saw how quickly the whole lot can disappear...It was gone within two minutes! I skipped the skimpy little plastic cups and grabbed a soup bowl to fill with buttery business.\n\n  Trip report: \n- 3 plate-loads of crab legs\n- Loaded shrimp/scallop stir fry (mixed in with my last batch of crab meat.. yumm)\n- Sushi: This is up to your ability to discern old from new - they DO seem to leave rolls sitting there but they are constantly making new ones (to order!)\n- Steam bar: Savory sui-mai, pork buns, and some sweet donut-tasting hot pastries, etc..\n- Steamed mussels on ice\n- Roasted duck - maybe 5-spice seasoning? Tasted good (note: no knives supplied to cut meat from bone!)\n- Steamed/grilled sole fillets and (dry) baked salmon\n\n  All in all, its fairly standard Asian buffet fare unless you consider the snow crab to be enough to justify the upcharge from the average $10-12 to $18 per adult. Until I find a better price this will remain my go-to spot for bottomless snow crab.. Though for around this price there are better buffets (See Wandering Horse Buffet in Scottsdale)", "type": "review", "business_id": "KpCKaIDZ1m4bQj2ur3olfg"}

But now that I'm a \"grown-up\" I can honestly say that I can cook! It took major life changes and the possibility of starvation to do it, but through cookbooks and the internet, I can boldly say that I am able to cook anything as long as I've got a recipe! So when we went to the Sweet Basil cooking school for a work outing I was excited to put my cooking skills to the test.\n\nWe started off with Linda our instructor giving us an overview of what we were cooking and she had us volunteer to break off into pairs. She asked for one person to go solo and I raised my hand. Our menu for the evening was \"Easy Entertaining\" and were a mix of sweet and savory dishes. I had the task of making grilled chicken satay skewers. It took about 90 minutes for everyone to finish cooking and we ate the dishes as they were completed. Each recipe was easy to prepare and there were a handful I'd choose to make at home for parties. My skewers needed to be grilled and that's a skill I've never honed so it was nice to do something new! Our instructor Linda was very nice and she reminded me of the days when I used to cook with my grandmother. She was very encouraging and made me feel really great about my dish! I think in my next life I will go to culinary school and become a chef! Not so I can open a restaurant per se, but simply because I enjoy creating dishes and making folks happy through food!\n\nGreat team building exercise and a nice change from the regular sit down dinners. It's BYOB but I'd warn that you should probably eat something before hand because it'll be awhile before you get to eat your dinner!

[cue angelic voices...**ahhhhhh**] \n\nThe lovely presented me with a spa gift cert for three services. When I arranged the appointment, I asked if I could increase the massage time from 60 to 90 minutes in lieu of the second service and was told 'of course'. So I booked a 90 minute stone massage and a pedicure. \n\nThe day of the appointment - my birthday - I was greeted with a 'happy birthday' and shown to the women's shower/changing/steam room. Its not fair to call it a locker room, its simply too lovely for that. There is a second 'relaxation room' where you can sip tea an enjoy small bites while you wait. Delightful.\n\nAs for the massage itself, may I just say that it was the most relaxing 90 minutes of my life?? It was one of those times where time goes by much more quickly than you want. I didn't want it to end. The room has a vaulted ceiling with what look to be the original beams. It has two tables and shower heads above each for the citrus scrubs [yikes did that sound sexy...] The woman [you can ask for gender preference if you like] who worked on me - Carol, I think - was great. I was kept warm the whole time either by her hands holding the smooth warm stones or by the perfect weight of the covers over the rest of me. I felt perfectly taken care of. My 5x operated shoulders have never felt so relaxed. I walked out of there and into the ahhhhmaaaazing not-locker room [stocked with everything - and I do mean everything - you might need, right down to qtips, shave cream and disposable razors] where an out of town guest asked me what I had done and she told me I looked stoned. All of that without drugs!! The showers, walk in and large enough for a family of 5, are similarly equipped with all of the spa products to use and enjoy. Lovely. \n\nAs an aside, I don't mean to short-change the pedi but I am a girl who has frequent pedi's, so this was less of a treat than the massage which I'm less likely to get for myself. It was pleasant, in a nice atmosphere but nothing seriously out of the ordinary. And sorry my lovely, but not worth 80+ dollars. \n\nThere are nooks outdoors - each with lounge chairs and fireplaces - where you can relax and unwind further. Or you can have lunch there with your book - which I did. Menu, lunch, it all comes to you quickly, sweetly, happily. Makes me wish I lived there. Its quiet and lovely and is a great match to the experience itself. The staff is kind and attentive and a dot on the i of the incredible experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rLAeltELaGdQKh_LYIllEA"}

This is a great place to get some tasty Mexican food and margaritas. The Prickly Pear Margarita is wonderful, but you have to have a sweet tooth for it, however, their regular lime margaritas are some of the best in town. \n\nThe Motto of the restaurant is \"Some like it hot\" and for the most part, you do need to like spicy food to eat here. There are menu items that are low on the spicy side, however the salsas are usually pretty hot. When I say \"usually\" it means that it isn't always very spicy and this when people can be disappointed in the restaurant. Everything is homemade and made by scratch, which is a good thing but doesn't mean everything is going to be the same. The chili's that they use to make the salsa and sauces etc, are spicy depending on the season. (Just like in the store, you can only really get cherries at certain times). I've found the the summer season, esp. June is when Molinos is at its hottest (ate there a few days ago and had to down 3 huge glasses of water to make it through the meal).  In the winter months things are usually not very hot there.. But still tasty. \n\nWhat I usually get is the Carne Adovada Chimichanga with green chili.. it is to die for, I've gotten it many times and I would have to say its one of the best chimichanga I have ever had. A couple of other items that are good is the blue corn enchiladas with green chill and the carne adovada platter is excellent. \n\nThe reason Molinos doesn't get five stars is because service can sometime be.. interesting. This one on Washington isn't very busy, however, it seems like there is really only one waiter taking care of the restaurant so it can take time to place orders, but food comes out quickly. \n\nThe Molinos on Central Ave, there are more servers but it ten times busier and when the servers/hostess gets stressed out they tend to take it out on the costumers.. I had called in to get a table of eight reserved, however, when I got there with five of us and the other three where in the parking lot. I asked for our table and the hostess looked at us and asked for the rest of our party. I  explained that they were on their way in. And she replied well they're not with you, we're giving your table away. My three other people walked in before she finished saying this and she refused to change her mind. \n\nI would highly recommend going to the Molinos on Washington instead of Central..", "type": "review", "business_id": "ho4Te6bO2tGs56h9PF2vuA"}

If you have a tourist and want to really give them the Barrio Burrito experience, this is it. Everything is well worn-in and the look of things might scare off the meek gringo. But it is exceptionally clean and the staff are friendly. The Chimichanga shouldn't be eaten any further than 20' from the front door, if you don't have time to eat it there: take another look at your life's priorities or order something else. I've had the amazing Red Chili Beef almost every visit, but last time had the Rice & Bean Chimi which may be a new veg fav. The beef tacos are those amazingly greazy corn shells that may or may not be totally deep-fried, order extra hot sauce and don't ask silly questions. Rice & refried beans are just as they should be and even make a tostada delicious! They sell bags of fresh tortilla & chips, but I've never seen nachos on the menu. Everything they do have on the menu though is best-in-class, assuming you like this class.

This is perhaps the most relaxing place to sit and have lunch around Tempe.  The white patio is shaded by sail-like blue awnings which reminds you of that great trip to Greece you wish you had actually taken.  The only drawback for tall peeps is that the seating is a little lower than normal, tiled benches and cushioned stools, which leave me straining under my now heavier weight ever time I get up to leave, but... maybe I should just stay.\n\nI have had many of the dishes on the menu here and have been satisfied on every occasion.  This is properly prepared and portioned middle-eastern food, cooked with great skill and care.  The flavors don't pop for me on every dish, but that doesn't keep me from coming back on an almost weekly basis.\n\nFavorite dishes here are the veggie platter, the fatoosh salad and the labneh plate.  This was one of the first places I've ordered labneh and I am now a serious strained yogurt fan.  It might not sound very appetizing, but labneh is seriously good snack food and a great change from the typical hummus and baba routine.  Think thick, semi-sour cream cheese served with pita and olives.  Definitely Mediterranean, a nice snack while in your cabana.\n\nI love the two candies they have by the register here: Turkish Delight and Cotton Candy.  The Cotton Candy is like a little spun sugar pile that resembles more of something you'd find under your bed than a dessert, but that makes all the more fun to eat as you walk out the door and return to the desert.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TsmBNiwMMeb8aRrZs00JBA"}

Let me preface this by saying I'm a Bruins fan, they are currently winning game 6 so I feel good.  Back to the review, check on the game; one star.  Any restaurant choice and subsequent review should balance expectation with performance...you don't go to Longhorn expecting Morton's. That said, they had maybe 10 wines to choose from, which exceeded my expectation, so another star.  I ordered the Outlaw Ribeye, bone in and medium rare.  It could have used another minute on the grill, but it was seasoned well and tasted great.  Bone-in was a pleasant surprise, plus it was cooked and seasoned well...star plus a half for the bone.  By the way, asparagus was good, but I was missing the advertised lemon flavor.  A lemon wedge provided quickly by the bartender remedied the situation.  Service...I was at the bar and service was great.  Rich was tending bar, he did a great job.  Last star.  Well, in the time I wrote this the Bruins gave up 2 goals in 17 seconds win a minute left to lose the Stanley Cup.  I'm downtrodden and therefore rounding down...\n\nDon't let a NHL game skew your read of this review.  Longhorn delivered on my expectation.

Here are the dishes that really stood out to me. In fact, they didn't just stand out, but smacked me in the face with all their fishy goodness:\n\n1) Crispy Spicy Tuna: on fried sushi rice, unagi sauce & serrano chile ($10)\n\n2) Fresh Seared Hamachi: seared yellowtail, onion, tomato, petite greens, yuzu & white truffle oil drizzle ($17)\n\n3) Big Eye Tuna: seared big eye tuna with teriyaki vinaigrette over japanese mushroom risotto ($24)\n\n4) Sashimi Plate: chef's choice of 5 different, 3 piece sashimi selections ($21)\n\nAlso, make sure you try the Kiwi Collins which is a mixed drink of Pineapple Vodka, fresh kiwi, lemon juice & soda ($10)\n\nThe service was efficient and friendly (and yes, the waitresses were exceptionally hot as some other reviewers mentioned) and we all found this sushi joint to be a solid experience.\n\n-----\n\nDistinguishing factor: Fantastic specialties that are sure to please, coupled with a pleasant  Old Town vibe.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9VZ_imQjvgtpt3k6W6AQ_A"}
